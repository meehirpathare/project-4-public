I talked about my love for accounting, my desire to become a mentor for community college students, inspire other students at my community college to aim for higher goals, and my 10-week program with Harvard's Business School called HBX cORE\n3 more days! I'm so nervous!

During the earlier phases of my transfer process, I took up a lot of valuable information from CC members and now that I am done, I wanted to give back to this community.\nAfter being rejected from every college or waitlisted by every college I wanted to go to and attending my state school for a year, I was accepted to both Cornell and UPenn as a transfer sophomore this year; I will be attending Penn as part of the Class of 2020. I do want to emphasize that this process was NOT easy but it was so so so worth it looking back.\nFrom my experience, it is QUINTESSENTIAL to not just get good, but SHINING, OUTSTANDING recommendations from your professors. Applying to transfer during your freshmen year makes this all the more harder -- you only have one semester to hustle and get your name known to your professors. But there IS a way to do it. It's to go to office hours frequently, show a GENUINE appreciation and interest in the subject (reflected in your thoughtful questions), and to SUCCEED in the course, as in try your best to get to the top of the class. After my transfer process was over, my chemistry professor later sent me the rec he submitted so I could use it for a scholarship. He clearly mentioned that I was a frequenter of his office hours and that I was in the top 3% of his general chemistry course. I believe this had a very strong sway in my acceptance to Penn.\nAfter looking through previous successful transfer stats, I noticed that many of the accepted students had 4.0 GPAs their first semester/year. So I tried my absolute best to get a 4.0 my first semester of college and I did. Of course you don't HAVE to get a 4.0, and MANY students have been successful with transfer without one. But I do think having that pristine 4.0, especially from a more rigorous state or peer institution, helps an application a lot.\nYour essay is also very important in my opinion. I noticed that a common theme amongst successful transfer students was that they emphasized WHY their current school is NOT a good fit for them, whether it is academic, social, extracurricular, or some other factor. I don't think it matters as much what this particular reason is, but rather that you JUSTIFY it extremely well. I emphasized that staying at my current institution was NOT conducive to my current and future success. I simply could not expand my mind globally and academically with the students and resources at my current school.\nAlso it is very important to show that you GREW intellectually after spending a year or two at another institution. THIS is why colleges want transfer and international students in the first place. They want to diversify their student body by drawing in the best from other institutions; these students are bringing in their experiences, their wisdom, and their goals from different schools all over the country and world. Therefore it is important to show the colleges what YOU can bring to the table after spending time somewhere else. I personally found that I learned so much about myself and my goals after spending a year at my state school. So I specifically mentioned in my essays why these personal lessons made me a more motivated and goal-oriented person and therefore a better applicant. Try asking yourself, what has changed since you applied to college as a senior?\n(For writing the essay, I would also suggest checking out the Transfer Book (online) as well as you write your essay. Although it's a bit expensive, I found that it was very helpful for viewing real sample essays and understanding what makes a compelling transfer applicant.)\nI hope that future transfer applicants will see this post and be able to take away something, just as I have with CC posts from the past. Best of luck, and know that your rejection now is not necessarily final. You HAVE THE POWER to turn things around. Don't lose hope and keep on running.

Had you been rejected by UPenn in high school before being accepted as a transfer?\n4.)

(the little batard speaks english better than me and he picked it up on the fly.) his family background is scientific and international, but there is also a shared, compelling interest in him eventually doing something that is financially rewarding. and more to the immediate point, he doesn\u2019t really know what he wants to study. now, i realize that these colleges (yes, he\u2019s applying to more than one\u2026 and they are all so different) want 17-year-olds to know what they are going to study, what work they are going to do afterward, where they are going to live and die, and to whom they are going to leave their money. but most kids i\u2019ve met (including the brainiacs) barely know what they are going to do this coming weekend, let alone what they are going to do with the rest of their lives.\nnow you may think, \u201cwell, these are very specific programs that direct students in very specific ways. if that kid doesn\u2019t know what he wants to do, he should get a job\u2026 join the army\u2026 find himself.\u201d no. he (and his family) want him to get into the most challenging program he can get into. right now\u2026 yesterday, if not sooner.

Subject tests have been waning in important for years. In Penn's case, they flat out say you will NOT be at a disadvantage if you don't take subject tests. There's no asterisk saying this doesn't apply to students who can afford to take the tests:\n\"SAT Subject Tests are recommended but not required. Applicants who do not take SAT Subject Tests will not be at a disadvantage in the admissions process.\"\nSo are we supposed to think Penn doesn't really mean that statement?? Based on what? Hearsay? Your gut?\nWhat makes sense is that elite universities want confirmation that top-notch grades are actually deserved. And, once again contrary to much of the advice here, results of AP/IB exams can serve as that confirmation. An applicant who has received AP 5s in core subjects can much more safely forego subject tests that someone who hasn't received top scores. If you've received 3s or below in core subjects, then I think you'd need extremely high subject scores to compensate.\nI don't work in admissions either, but honestly, the panicking over this issue seems excessive. There are so many more important parts of a student's application.

The thing is there are not too many people who are absolutely dead-set on studying business before their college career has even started and most know that they can break easily into business doing econ or sth else at HYPSM. Also a lot of the Wharton kids (myself included) tend to be especially prestige-concious and find it hard to turn down the lay prestige of HYPSM for the more niche prestige of Wharton. I was one such person, turned down Yale but it was a rather are decision at the time. However I met few other single-degree wharton kids who had done the same. At least this is my experiece (I graduated with the past five years).\nI think getting in ED at Penn and thus not applying to HYPSM is a bit different from actively choosing at over HYPSM when you have both acceptances at hand. But yes i agree that Wharton especially attracts many people ED that could potentially have been admitted to HYPSM.\nMy assessment is that a lot of Penn admits get cross-admitted to HYPSM, a tiny number of non-wharton kids chooses Penn over them, a bigger but still small number of wharton kids does so and a substantial number of dual degree kids chooses Penn.

In reality, I met lots of students who had done what I did. I also didn't quiz everyone I met on where they got in-- it was more through organic conversations about what the college process was like for us and seeing students at multiple admitted students days who eventually chose Penn with me that we discovered Penn-HYP cross admit wins weren't nearly as unheard of as they were made out to be in places like CC. It goes without saying that the majority of students in the College probably did not choose Penn RD over HYP schools (something that is probably true of the university as a whole and each of its schools as well), but we also weren't so few and far between.\nThere are also some non-dual-degree recruitment tools (like the Benjamin Franklin Scholars program and the University Scholars Program) that can appeal to someone who might ordinarily choose Princeton, for example, because of its perceived name recognition, but that might enjoy the academic opportunities at Penn even more once exposed to them through these programs. Again, it probably doesn't overcome the prestige-bump for lots of students who are admitted to both Penn and HYP, but there were students both inside and out of those programs who I came across that did just that.

So I think Wharton provides both a highly technical business education and a well-rounded general education. Same goes for for the non-wharton kids, they can get their liberal arts education plus get technical business skills though Wharton classes if they want to. Penn is very special is that way, imo.\nRegarding prestige, I think in business circles the Wharton name is probably only second to the Harvard name. But in terms of general prestige across industries and amongst the general population I think the HYPSM prestige eclipses the Wharton one. For cross-admits who are super focused on studying business that doesn't matter because they know Wharton is the best place out there for undergrad business. however, for the people who are thinking that they want to eventually end up in business but they are unsure of their major, the lay prestige consideration and the curriculum differences come into play.

You may interpret differently.\n\nIsn't the lower acceptance rate for international students a result of limited financial aid?\n\nNo. While FA is a factor, and intl students not requiring aid will be at less of a disadvantage, the reality is that Penn, and its peer schools, imposes a cap (either hard or soft) on the percentage of international students to the total, usually between 10-13%. Penn is on the higher end of the scale.

I'd like to know if I'm currently on the right track to being a solid candidate for Penn.

Just remember that there are also several other qualified applicants so just don't get too confident like some people I know, haha.\nAlso for ECs, be careful. Can you really run a non-profit and a business simultaneously? I mean sure, anyone can run them, but how successfully? While it's great to have ECs, make sure you're not just doing it for the resume. By starting a business, Penn can see you're capable of starting something and successfully running it. Will starting a non-profit take away time from your company? What's the point of doing both?\nPersonally, I would do the service that you plan doing through your nonprofit, through your business instead. Get other people involved. Service makes businesses desirable. Businesses are then seen as not only paid benefit to society, but also voluntary benefit to society.\nTalk to your counselor. See what he/she thinks:)\nFinal note: I think you're a fantastic candidate for Penn.

Here is my information:\nEducation:\n95% and above in all classes taken in high school, majority above 97%\nGPA: 4.208 (my school does not designate weighted or unweighted)\nHave taken a total of 8 AP classes, achieved highest average in those taken Junior year.\n5's on all AP tests taken\nhighest honors accolades given every year\n740 on Biology SAT Subject Test, 770 on US History SAT Subject Test\n1450 SAT (non-super score'd), most recent SAT scores have not yet been released\nSports:\ncaptain of the school bowling team since Junior year\nreceived varsity letters from Freshman unto Senior year\nreceived \"coach's award\" for high athletic achievement\ncoordinated summer practices for the team\nClubs:\nNational Catholic Forensics League; sophomore, junior, and senior year; won several local awards, qualified and participated in the national tournament Junior year\nDECA; junior and senior year; won several local awards, competed at the state level junior year\nStudent Government, homeroom representative junior and senior year\nNational Honors Society\nGolden Saints, a service club\nExtra-Curricular Work:\nService, have volunteered at a number of institutions including those for the elderly, the mentally disabled, rescued animals, and children; total of 120 hours at the present moment\nPiano, 5 years of practice\nGraphic design, I have several pieces of artwork I plan to submit\nYouTube, I run a medium-size (under 150,000 subscriber) youtube channel based on informative educational essays\nWriting, I research and write small essays on a variety of topics (none published as of yet)\nEssays and Recommendations:\nI lived in a low-income family for the majority of my life and because of personal circumstances will apply to college as an independent. Such information has been incorporated into the essay.\nMy recommendations should be solid, I've asked both my AP Biology teacher, who I know personally and in whose class I achieved a top average, and my AP US History teacher, who runs the Forensics team at school, for recommendations. I've also asked one of my other teachers, who now works at a non-profit research institution in New York, and my piano instructor for supplemental recommendations.

OP, even with the $200K it's possible you will get some aid, especially with 4 children; it depends on your family's circumstances. But it may not be the aid you are looking for. However, it's unlikely you will get different purely need-based aid anywhere else either.\nWhat people are talking about when they say apply RD is not the pure financial need offers that schools like Penn offer, but merit-need scholarships that might be offered. This may be best for the OP. Merit-need is need that takes merit into account. Many non-Ivies, many excellent colleges, have such awards. That's where you may find you can compare/contrast offers. (Also pure merit,of course).\nFor instance, my D who got into Northwestern was a National Merit Finalist, and could have gone to some schools full ride. This would be a pure merit. My older S was awarded several merit-need scholarships from LACs that wanted him, and he ended up with full tuition-plus, although the NPC indicated less would be offered. It depends how much they want you. This is where RD and comparing/contrasting comes in.\nThat said, Penn ED can certainly be a good decision if you are high/medium-high need. It worked for my son.

If your family circumstances are such that you and your parents genuinely can't afford the net cost even after aid, then you need to ask for a release from ED and look at other options. As always, whether you have an excellent career depends more on you and what you do than on where you go to school.\nI only meant that needing to compare costs among schools is really only necessary when you are comparing comparable schools.

Are they willing to do that? From what you say in other posts your parents make $200k and won't help you pay for college -- what makes you think they will guarantee all this debt for you? Have you asked them? It is unlikely that you will get a ton of need based aid at your parent's income level.\nSecond if you do take out a tremendous amount of debt to fund Wharton the debt payments over the next decade or more would tie your hands and limit your future choices. For example you might not be able to take that lower paying job that offers a fantastic experience, you may not be able to consider grad school, etc.\nIf your parents truly won't help you out for college or are not willing/able to pay what the NPC indicates the cost will be, then you should spend more of your time seeking out schools that have great guaranteed merit aid (ex.

It is June. Penn's ED is Nov. 1. So, what to do in the meantime?\n1) Relax a little bit. Prepare your application as if you were going to apply to Wharton ED. Getting an early start is good and worst case scenario is you send it in RD a few weeks later.\n2) Meanwhile, agressively explore your options. Without knowing your stats, state residence etc., it's impossible to say (and it's hard even if I did know your stats) but assuming you are a high-stat student aggressively interested in business I would suggest you deep dive into lower-cost, high quality business programs. If you were, for instance, a CA or Mich or Texas or VA (or a number of other states) resident, it would not make much sense to go deep in debt and forgo Cal/UCLA or UMich or UVa undergrad for Penn - ESP if you are thinking MBA. And the cost difference, assuming very little need aid, could be quite significant.\nLook at stats for places that give good/decent aid for a student with your stats. There are a lot of threads on them in CC. See if you could imagine attending one of them even if you got into Penn/Wharton.\nAlso, if you really think you will get little to no aid, you might want to look at private scholarships. (My kid, now a rising soph, just learned they got a 5k private scholarship on top of their merit aid for next year. Since we are full pay, all scholarship and merit money is pure profit... well, pure \"non-debt.\" One of our agreements with our kid was they promised to be aggressive in chasing scholarships. So far so good.) One hint, go after bigger money scholarships. They all take the same amount of time (generally) to apply to.\nThen, in Sept, take a deep breath, have another money conversation with your parents, look at your list and decide if Penn ED makes sense (and if you even have a way of financing it. If your parents or someone else won't contribute a fair bit, you likely can't borrow the kind of money it would take anway.) Or you might want to use an ED application on a school that is more likely to give you more money (or on one, like Columbia, that also allows you to apply to state schools at the same time as ED. I don't recall if Penn does that.)\nBut my suggestion to every rising senior, use your summer to do as much deep college research as you can. You are about to spend 4 years of your life, 10s to 100s of thousands of yours or your parents money (and in your case, perhaps locking yourself into years of monthly debt payments.) Esp since you are considering grad school, being a \"Wharton Undergraduate Grad\" will usually mean much less than being a \"XXXX Masters or Phd or MD\" grad.\nGood that you are considering this early. Work on your common app and Penn applications this summer regardless. Good luck!

If they live frugally on $60,000 per year, assuming that the mortgage is already paid off, that leaves $60,000 left to pay for universities. With 4 kids in university at once, that is $15,000 per student. This may be optimistic for several reasons.\nIf you want to go to medical school, you should avoid debt altogether if you possibly can, and DEFINITELY if it is possible at all don't take out any more debt than the $5,500/6,500/7,500/7,500 limit that a student can take out without a co-signer.\nCan you do U.Penn for no more than $20,000?

The main is prob size. Penn has an average of about 300 kids applying every year. By comparison Chicago has about 100. Another thing to consider is the type of medical schools students shoot for. On that page you linked, you can see that the most popular med schools for Penn students are Harvard, Penn, Columbia, Cornell. These are some of the very very top in the country.

Of those, 51 people matriculated to one of the top 15 medical schools, which is about 21% of the total number of people who applied and almost 30% of the people who were accepted to at least one medical school. The number of people who actually got accepted to these schools is most prob higher , but difficult to calculate exactly.\nRegarding the gap year, keep in mind that Penn students tend to be quite pre-professional. It is not at all uncommon for them to accept a job offer and while doing that prepare for medical school. I personally know a lot of people who accepted positions in healthcare consulting firms, healthcare VC, banking and hospitals (in research and business roles), and then went on to medical school, because they wanted to get some real work experience before med school.
