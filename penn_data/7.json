I love learning about global econ and investment banking, specifically the US and global stock markets, so naturally, I was interested in Wharton at UPenn. ECO definitely got me SUPER interested in UPenn, I absolutely loved the philosophies of the school and the incredible environment and it seems perfect for my character and interests, but I digress. So, about me, I am a junior at a private Catholic high school in Towson/Baltimore, Maryland. I have two citizenships for the United States and Portugal, my parents emigrated from Sweden and Portugal for various reasons when they were in their 20s. My economic background is irrelevant because UPenn doesn't consider that in their application process. I am considered latino on my applications because my father is Portuguese and Spanish. Also, my great uncle is Antonio Guterres of the UN. Academically, I am probably top 10% of my class which has 330 students. I am in my school's most rigorous academic scholars program along with about 20 others. I have an unweighted 92/4.0 GPA my sophomore and junior years, and an 88 as a freshman. With my school's weight system, it translates to a 98/4.0 and 94/4.0, respectively. I am a National Merit Scholarship Qualifier but didn't receive any grants from NMS but did get one from my father's company per my PSAT score. I got 1500 on the SAT and 34 on the ACT. APs don't matter in the selection process but I have taken AP Physics, APWH, and APUSH. In terms of extracurriculars, 2 time VEX Robotics world championship qualifier, once 9th in the world and once 40th. I am the founder and president of the FBLA chapter at my school, no competition yet. 3 years of JV Cross Country, 3 years of JV Outdoor Track (winter), and 1 year of JV Tennis and 1 year of Varsity Tennis. I also am involved in some leadership roles at my school and have about 30 hours of service. 1 year as an NHS member, which was not available as a Freshman or Sophomore. 2 years as Spanish National Honors Society member, not available as a freshman. 2 years as a STEM member, not available as a freshman. Wharton is currently my dream and stretch school, if anyone can tell me my chances of getting in or any questions about my transcript, let me know, please. Thank you very much for reading this and responding, much appreciated. p.s. I am applying for early decisionmod note: combined/edited together two very similar threads.

That said, ED also has LOTS of strong applicants that are just as good if not better than you. I stand by my previous post that it is to a certain point based on luck. Yes you are qualified but so are many others. Yes you have a chance but so do all those that apply.\nSo a quick anecdote: I fell in love with penn too actually during my hs years and I too applied ED - i was denied. I had your same ACT score, I was in the IB program despite being in the states, ranked 7 out of 300ish students, 4.3 weighted gpa, and held many piano concerts at carnegie hall, lincoln center, and other respected venues along with competing nationally and holding titles in music competitions, plus my other ECs of independent research and sports.\nWhatever Penn was looking for, it wasn't me. I guess they felt that I just wasn't a fit for them. So here's the other thing: not only do YOU need to love the school, but the school has to love you back. The school needs to think that you will fit in with the environement, with the existing students, etc. That said, I do encourage you to cast a wider net and find other attractive qualities in other top schools if thats what you are aiming for. Why not apply to all ivies to increase you chances? If denied, it doesn't mean you didn't have what it takes, because many that do get rejected could have easily succeeded there. It just means that perhaps, the school felt that you wouldn't fit in.\nSo don't stress. I got into other top 15 schools and despite not going to my 'dream school', everything worked out swell!

Although everyone will have a story about someone who was admitted without Subject Tests, my view in these cases is that there was probably more to the story (e.g. seriously hooked or lower SES).\nPersonally, I cannot imagine why an applicant to a school that rejects 92% of its applicants would choose to omit any part of an application. Of course, if you take them, and your scores are low, then yes, I would omit them.

For one, does the school I'm currently at now hold great importance? I go to a small college in NYC as a commuter, and it doesn't have the best reputation. I find the classes to be easier than what I took in high school, and most students here don't care about school. All in all, the school is set up to cater to the needs of students who, for the most, struggled in high school, and I am quite the opposite. I attended the University of Michigan my first semester (Fall 2017), and decided on transferring out all too quickly due to personal reasons, (severe homesickness that turned into anxiety & depression). While I have the option to go back to Mich within a 2 year timespan, I think the distance will just be a problem again, and the same thing might happen. So, only a small possibility I'll go back.\nNonetheless, I know I need more of a challenge and a better environment where I can grow personally & intellectually, and I don't see that happening where I am. That's why I'm looking into schools that are within 2-3 hours of NYC and have strong academics. Among them is Penn which I had the chance to walk around the other day, and really liked what I saw. I'd love to go back and get more of a feel, while classes are in session in the fall. I'm also looking into Temple, and would like to look into Villanova & maybe Wesleyan (CT) too. If any one can give me a feel of what my odds would be of being admitted, I'd really appreciate it.\nMain reason why Penn tops my list right now is because they're the only other school I'm aware of that has the major I planned to pursue at Michigan: Philosophy, Politics, & Economics\nHigh School GPA: 94.13 (not sure how this translates on a 4.0 scale exactly). Magna Cum Laude\n4 AP Courses\nACT was low, 26, but SAT was better: 1300 (still not Ivy high though). Also took a Subject Test in U.S. History and did fairly well.\nI really slack in high school extracurriculars: was on a Varsity team for my senior year, but played soccer all 4 years outside of school with a local organization.\nGPA from First Semester at Michigan: 3.92\nEC's at Mich: 2 student Orgs, one social & the other more advocacy\nGPA from Second Semester at new school: 4.0\nI'm apart of one club here right now (an ethnic one) and participated in intramural basketball\nI know that this is only part of the admission decision, but I'd love to know where I stand for Penn or the other schools mentioned. Will the fact that I transferred in the first place from Michigan, a great school, to a small lesser known, \"easy\" school cause I was homesick, make me less of a competitive applicant? Should I just suck it up and head back to Ann Arbor to finish?\nThanks.

Like half a year ago I discovered the DMD (digital media design) major of UPenn and love it so much.\nCuz personally I do robotics and some UI design for engineering related, but at the same time also do graphic design at school (I am the leader of the school graphic design club, I would love to have a major under engineering but involves some artistic elemenets. And DMD of UPenn fits me so much. I do a lot of other things as well, but these are generally the major ones.\nI haven't attended much competitions apart from FIRST Robotics Competition (only that this one is group work), but got a 1500 and 1490 SAT respectively, and am taking the May one this Saturday as my last, hopefully it will be higher than the first. I also have double 800 on maths 2 and physics, and probably will take a chemistry this fall before application.\nFor schoolwork, I take IB diploma: Chinese SL, English HL, French ab SL, Physics HL, Maths HL and Economics SL. All of these scores are 7 right now (the highes rank) and I believe right now I am in the top 10% of my peers.\nMy key concerns are related to the courses. Because DMD is under CS, while I took neither CS nor art (while my school offers them), how can I or will I ever make up to these? The portfolio would not be a problem for me. But another thing is that even though my high school is among the top ones in China, UPenn seem to not favor it and has not been admitting much students for a long time.\nThis summer I will be attending the computer graphics summer program that related to this field in Penn, and the professor there would also be one of the staff of DMD undergrad, so this might be a bonus if I do well there.\nSo, that's basically all about me, and I would really appreciate it if anyone could tell me about my chances and if there's anything more I can do~ OR if there are any more info about UPenn DMD's admission (I know there is not much online ), please do share it!\nThanks  ", "user_id": "100673690", "user_name": "vikiii ", "user_thread_count": "3", "user_comment_count": "70"}, {"date": {"month": "May", "day": "2,", "year": "2018", "time": "1:56AM"}, "comment": "\nAnyone also interested in DMD or Penn are also welcome here!

I am a recent Wharton admit (not M&T) and plan to attend Penn this fall. By no means am I an admissions expert but I'd still love to offer my take on ur circumstances\nYour grades, test scores, and course rigor are all great. DO NOT stress over these things (or 3 Bs, I had 3 Bs as well just from high school classes).\nYou have various leadership positions and EC involvement which is nice, but one thing I would suggest would be to use these organizations, and ur leadership positions in them, to make a communal impact. One of the largest things they stressed about during the admitted students days was how they want their students not simply to be successful for themselves but make the community/society successful as a whole. Maybe help organize a program within your club where you can volunteer to teach kids how to code and work on your public speaking skills (that u mentioned earlier) by speaking/directing a class of younger students. Have large-scale fundraising events within ur school/community so that you will be able to financially sustain this volunteering coding program, assuming that is something you'd be interested in doing. This is only one example of a million things you could do.\nIn short, whatever you do, make sure you do it to the fullest, not just to add another empty EC that many other students around the country can easily join/do.

Below is some info about me.\nNote: At my school, unless you transfer from homeschooling and have had the opportunity to take more advanced courses, we can only start taking AP courses Junior year, and many of the AP classes can only be taken Senior year. Also, we have less than 10 AP classes available (which are only available once a day) and we do not have an IB program, as it is a small school.\nRace and Gender: White Female\nLegacy Status: not a legacy\nGPA (as of Sophomore Year)\nUnweighted: 4.00\nWeighted: 4.54\n8th Grade (counted as high school course):\nHonors Algebra 1: A\nFreshman Grades:\nHonors English: A\nHonors Geometry: A\nBible (required class and only CP): A\nPhysical Science (only CP): A\nWorld History (only CP): A\nYearbook: A\nSophomore Grades (as of 3rd quarter, but it looks like it will be my grades for the year):\nHonors Civics/ Economics: A\nHonors English: A\nBible (still required and CP): A\nHonors Algebra 2: A\nChorale (will be honors junior and senior year): A\nHonors Biology: A\nClasses I Plan to Take Junior Year:\nHonors PreCalculus\nHonors Chemistry\nBible (required CP)\nHonors US History\nAP English\nHonors Chorale\nAP Music Theory\nMy Senior year, I hope to take AP Chemistry, AP English, AP Calculus, and AP US History along with Chorale and maybe another elective.\nI am taking Spanish classes online for my foreign language requirement as the classes my school offers do not fit my schedule. I hope to take up to Spanish 3 if possible.\nExtracurricular:\n-I participate in theatre weekly at Spiritual Twist Productions and am in 2-3 shows a year.\n-I volunteer to help run a younger theatre class at the same place weekly and help them put on a full production.\n-I am apart of the school praise team which helps lead the school in worship during chapel.\n-I was part of the Girls Buddies Club and will be co-directing it next year.\n-Although Chorale is a class, I count it as an extracurricular because we perform at many church concerts throughout the year and are performing at Carnegie Hall this summer.\n-I am part of Beta Club.\nOther things:\n-I did All-State choir.\n-I was elected as Sophomore representative for homecoming.\nIn the next two years, I plan to continue all of my extra curricular and I hope to get involved in more volunteering that has to do with nursing (there is a local medical ministry I hope to get involved with in some way). Academically, I hope to continue to take as many honors and AP classes as possible, hoping to take 2 AP classes next year and 4 my Senior year.\nThanks,\nMacey ", "user_id": "100626944", "user_name": "tthemacmonster ", "user_thread_count": "7", "user_comment_count": "10"}]}, {"topic": "Rescinding Offers", "url": "https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-pennsylvania/2074641-rescinding-offers.html", "comments": [{"date": {"month": "April", "day": "15,", "year": "2018", "time": "4:49PM"}, "comment": "\nPrior to applying and sending in my mid-year report to Penn, I am generally getting A\u2019s and B\u2019s, but now I have a C in my English class.

First off, congrats for admission into both schools! They're both amazing! I was in exactly the same situation as you: choosing between UCLA and Penn. At first, I was also leaning more towards UCLA because of the social life, school spirit etc. and I found Penn's community quite intimidating. But after doing more research on academics (I'm also planning to do pre-med) as well as social life at both schools, I found that Penn will probably be the better choice for me. Not just because it's an Ivy, but other reasons like average class sizes are smaller than UCLA's (I heard lots of students are good friends with their profs and go out to lunch and stuff), better research opportunities (since Penn is well known as a research institution, which is good for pre-meds!), a supportive community (not as cutthroat as other Ivys although still competitive) etc. But keep in mind this is all from my perspective! As for social life/community, if you haven't already, I would highly recommend joining the facebook page for the class of 2022 for both universities! I joined Penn's page two days ago and have already met some awesome people with the same interests and hobbies as me! The students are not nearly as intimidating as I had initially imagined. Most of them are pretty funny and encouraging! This would be a great way to see if you can fit in the community before/if you go to Quaker/Bruin day. I hope this helped! Good luck and remember that at the end of the day you'll end up where you belong!

I started a Business under his guidance though, so he has some good material to talk about. I just don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a good choice since he doesn\u2019t exactly express a preference for me over other students...I have an A in this class.\n3) Vice-Principal- He was happy to write a LOR for me for an internship I applied for(decision pending). Nice guy, knows me mainly for my leadership activities. I\u2019ve started a club at my school as well founded and run a fundraiser under his guidance. Only problem is that I don\u2019t see him on a daily basis. More like weekly/monthly basis so I can keep him updated on the club\u2019s progress. He recently pushed my club to the school board and got it approved as a legit recognized club, which is a huge help...\nFor reference, I\u2019m planning on majoring in finance/econ(if Finance is not offered at the school) and will most likely be applying ED to Wharton and EA to UChicago.\nWhat do you guys think?

The Penn - Penn State confusion is understandable - especially because Penn State is so widely recognized.\nI just haven't seen the same articles/op-eds about, say, Brown, Dartmouth, etc. Maybe people at Brown are annoyed that their school is confused with some other school, and the University has a FAQ answer about this.

When you assert that UChicago students may be more likely to describe their school as \"where fun goes to die,\" I would NOT use that info to determine the school is the \"least fun in the nation.\" Rather, I'd use it as a data point for consideration - it looks like some students view UChicago social life really negatively, in a way I can't seem to find to describe Penn, Yale, Stanford, etc.\nSimilarly, if I see a bunch of articles, an academic study, and a University-produced website describing Penn-Penn State confusion and doubt about the school's strength of brand, I would NOT automatically think that insecurity is rampant and the school has huge brand issues.

This is the key to unlock the differences in the different student body responses. Penn students are conditioned from the time they pay their deposit during HS senior year and are asked about their college plans. Some try to shorten a \"where to\" conversation with saying \"University of Pennsylvania\" and then just smile when someone still assumes Penn State.\nPenn State has an undergraduate student body of 85,000 versus Penn's 10,000. It's all about probability and what is more likely, not just football as some suggested... It dwarfs all other universities in any state with an IVY school...\nEven in New England, most adults (even those very well educated) do not differentiate between Penn and Penn State, and I assume that is the case for other parts of the country. Remember that New England parents have likely sat in the stands at a swim meet, track tournament, lacrosse tournament and looked across the Harvard, Dartmouth, Brown, Yale pool or field at all seven school emblems while their high school student is competing. The Penn name, location may still not be familiar.\nHowever, that does not at all diminish the Penn brand. Have your student treated by a specialist at any Harvard hospital and watch their expressions as they ask your son/daughter questions about where they go to school, their major and university research. Even with all the elite universities in NE, Penn students return home for the summer with incredible internship opportunities. Gauging their audience at another academic type institution or workplace, a Penn student may be more humble than their Ivy peers and answer the \"where question\" first with Philly, then University City, then Penn.\nThe more amusing part is when students finally arrive on Penn's campus, they are asked where they went to high school. If their response is Andover, Groton or Milton, MA or Exeter, NH it is automatically assumed that they went to boarding school. Tired of explaining that they do not go to Penn State and that they actually went to their public high school may be one reason some use the simple three letter word, Ivy, in a survey (surveys are not conversations).

That is an accurate statement and simply demonstrates good judgment by both groups of students.\nHowever, the use of the word \"insecure\" implies that they've demonstrated that the reason for Penn students mentioning Ivy League more often is that Penn students lack self-confidence (feel insecure/have low self-esteem) about attending Penn and think they have to try to impress others to feel good about themselves.\nApplying Ocham's Razor, I think the primary reason Penn students think the Penn brand is not as well known as the Harvard brand is that they have assessed the strength of the Penn brand correctly. That is entirely different than if the brands were equal but the students are feeling personally insecure.\nIt is possible that Penn students are more insecure compared to Harvard students, but they did not demonstrate that in this study.

The cream of the crop would go to Northwestern or UChicago. As a result, I spent a lot of senior year correcting people that I was not going to Penn State. I tried to describe my frustration to a friend as \"imagine you worked for years to get into Northwestern, and then once you get in everyone keeps congratulating you on Northeastern. They say go Huskies, give you red and black things, and tell you how beautiful Boston is. At this point it's not even an issue of prestige, it's just about how aggressively wrong people are, and you get really tired of telling people 'No, that's not actually the school I'm going to.'\" (In a weird coincidence, the inverse situation is happening this year to my friend who just got into Northeastern.)\nThanks to my reputation of being a high-achieving student, I also got more than one person ask me why I'm going to Penn State even though I could probably get into Harvard...\nAnyway, the point is that it's frustrating having people ask you about life at a school you don't attend, and any confusion of the type would cause the same frustration. In an ideal world I would say that Penn's March Madness appearance would help with our brand recognition, but I saw one bracket infographic that had Kansas playing Penn State, so I have no such hopes.

They are just aware of reality. The students are also not uncertain about the Penn brand. They are quite certain that the brand of their school is not very well known to most people\" and... \"Of course Penn's brand isn't as well known. Neither is anyone else's university brand [outside of Harvard et. al.].\"\nReally...? So if you asked students at Duke, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Georgetown, etc. \"is your brand well known to most people,\" you think almost all those students would answer no?\nAlso, UPenn students \"are quite certain that the brand... is not very well known to most people\" - really?\nHow do you know this? How can you state this so definitively?\nI think a better analysis would be, because UPenn students are UNCERTAIN how well the audience may know their brand, they use terms that have more traction (like \"ivy league\") to describe their school. To say Penn students are \"certain\" their brand is not very well known seems strange. Why would they be \"certain\" about that - especially when they don't know who the audience is?\nI think it'd also be strange to say that students at Duke, Hopkins, etc. are, as you would allege \"certain\" their school brands are not very well known. It'd be more accurate to say, at best, they are uncertain about their brands based on who the audience is, so they'd use other terms (highly ranked, or \"top school\") to describe their institutions.\nAnd even there, I have my doubts... If you asked a Dukie is your school well known, or someone from Hopkins or Georgetown, would they almost all say no? Really?\nI don't think you can group the analysis we see about Penn (like the poster above who complained about the confusion with Penn State) to some other places. Are Duke students annoyed that people always confuse their school for some other school? Do people at Johns Hopkins or Georgetown feel that way?\nI mean... come on.
