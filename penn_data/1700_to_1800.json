Chem Eng for example has even enrollment and Bio has more women.\nThe 23% includes required ED applications for athletes, children of alumni, QuestBridge and other programs.

They may also want to participate in Greek life. Most of them do not want to focus on only one aspect of one subject for four years.\nYour comment about the major makes sense, but if they did that, then all female applicants would pick CS and switch as soon as the were admitted. I believe they only consider your fit for engineering, and Penn, and are not focused on the particular major you identify, unless you are applying to one of the few specialized majors that require an additional application such as NETS or DMD.\nI should also add that a common difference between the male and female applicants for a subject like CS, is that, on average, the male admits will have stronger engineering-related ECs and probably started coding at a younger age than their female counterparts. In contrast, the ladies, are quite likely to have stronger overall academic credentials than the guys.

But do I have any chance at even getting in?\nMAJOR STUFF:\nUnweighted GPA: 3.9\nWeighted GPA: 4.9\nTotal AP's: 13 (4 during senior year)\nStudied abroad in Japan for a year.\n1520 SAT, 34-35 ACT\nExpect 750-800 SAT Japanese w/ Listening\nRecs: Doing a Business and Sales Internship 12hrs/week at international PR firm. And exchange, but that's different. Otherwise 100 hrs random community service.\nDETAILS:\nFreshman and Sophomore: Went to a high-level school, took 6 AP's total through freshman and sophomore year. Mostly 5's, two 4's on the exam. I did get a B in AP Physics and a C in the first semester of freshman Pre-calc (got an A second sem) -- could that hurt my chances? Will colleges be more forgiving of blemishes on freshman grades?\nJunior Year: Study Abroad in Japan for 11 months through Rotary. Awesome experience; going to write my personal essay on this. I'm advanced-intermediate (JLPT 3) in Japanese thanks to this program. I also took three AP classes online (and got all 5's and A's): AP Macro, English Lit, and Calc BC.\nSenior Year, probably all A's:\nAP US History\nAP Art History\nAP Computer Science A\nAP Microeconomics\nAICE Business\nDual-Enroll Calc 3 w/ Analytic Geo (Sem 1)\nDual-Enroll World Lit (Sem 1)\nDual-Enroll Introduction to Business (Sem 2)\nDual-Enroll British Lit (Sem 2)\nSAT is 1520, haven't taken ACT yet but expect 34-35. Expect an SAT II in Japanese w/ Listening around 750+, maybe 780-800.

Will be a Sophomore next semester.\nGPA:\n-I transferred in with a 3.79\n-Most of my LPS classmates entered the program ranging from 3.5-4.0\n-Apply anyway, even if you feel your GPA is not strong. I've heard of a few students being admitted around a 3.0. Rumor has it, there are a few \"traditional students\" who got in with below a 3.0, but I think they are student athletes.\nFinancial Aid:\n-My package is about 80%-grants & scholarships, 20% Fed. Loans\n-LPS doesn't have the same financial power as Penn's Student Aid due to funding, donors, and endowments, but for the most part, they're good at covering your financial needs. Just don't expect much more.\n-You may need to take outside personal loans\n-You are required to have health insurance to attend Penn. What sucks is, Penn is very picky with what insurance you bring in. It basically has to be top notch medical insurance or they wont accept it. I wish I would have known this before I finalized my financial aid package, so I could have planned things better :-/ Penn Ins. is $3,311 a YEAR!!! It's ridiculous. It does cover A LOT, but it was depressing to see the excess money I had borrowed, as a financial cushion for emergencies, was taken away by my Penn Ins. So, plan accordingly!!!\nHousing:\n-Graduate dorms are recommended for LPS students. I have a friend who is staying an Sansom East and pays around $850/month. It's about a 9'x13' dorm style room, and he shares a bathroom with his neighboring roommate. I didn't like the feel, because it felt like a jail cell. Maybe it's because I've always lived in a more spacious apartment setting and never had to share a bathroom.\n-There are some nicer and larger apt style dorms, but you'd be easily paying $1,000 - $2,500.\n-I'm renting off campus (44th/Walnut), and there are many students who do so. I'm paying about $550/month with rent and utilities. I got REALLY lucky! If you can find a place around $600-$750, you are in good shape.\n-Try to stay East of 45th street. Some of the neighborhoods are rough and dangerous (between 33rd St.- 45th St. is recommended). I strongly suggest you visit the area and see for yourself before you secure a lease. Penn campus is beautiful though.\nAdmission:\n-LPS looks for students with various professional and personal backgrounds, with the hunger to succeed in a challenging and rich environment. The more unique and interesting you are, the better your chances.\n-I don't know the acceptance rate so if anyone can share what they know, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n-During New Transfer Student Orientation on 8/30/12, LPS accepted 90 students from all over the world, not just the country.\n-It's competitive, but again I don't know how competitive.\n-I met one LPS student during orientation who was 19 years old. So, they do take students under 21. I'm sure it depends on the experience of the applicant though.\nTransfer in credits:\n-Be ready to not get many of your classes transferred, unless you are coming from a very reputable 4-year college.\n-I only received 5.5 CU's (5 classes) from ALL the 20 classes I've completed. \n-Wharton School of Business doesn't take in ANY business classes from community colleges. Even if you don't plan on taking Wharton classes, all business related courses are evaluated by a dept. at Wharton. I was hoping to get my Accounting & Business classes as electives. NOPE! It was REJECTED!\nMy Current Experience:\n-I truly enjoy the change in environment, culture, and expectations.\n-I'm struggling to stay above a 3.0 this first semester. Penn DOES NOT play! Lol. Most classes are very challenging. I took Calc.1 at my Comm. College, and am taking Calc. 1 again at Penn. It's intense! Most 2 and 4-year colleges would consider Penn's Calc. 1 (Math 104) as Calc 2.\n-I enjoy the smaller student to teacher ratio. Most of my classes (seminars) have about 15-20 students.\n-LPS classes are diverse, traditional and non-traditional students are all mixed in. So you wont feel segregated from the school.\n-Day classes are less diverse. Most are 17-20 year olds. Although, most students at Penn are well composed, intelligent, and thoughtful. I haven't seen any students who are not ambitious, and not want to be at Penn.\n-Students come from all over the world. I speak 3 languages (English, Khmer, Spanish) and thought I was ahead of the game coming into Penn, but I was wrong. Ha...It seems like 3 is the average numbers of languages spoken by students here. They're mostly great kids, except for the snotty and arrogant rich kids. lol. If you are all about celebrity status; Denzel Washington, Vera Wang, and Donald Trump's kids are current Penn students  That's just one little interesting fact.\nAll-in-all, your school experience is exactly what you make of it. If you work hard and smart, you'd succeed. That goes for any school. I'm slowly adjusting to the challenging environment and enjoying it. The opportunities are endless here at Penn, but YOU will have to go out and search for them. It's competitive and nothing is going to be handed to you on a silver platter. Join a club or an intramural sport to help balance your rigorous course load. I'm on Penn's HYPE Dance Team, and they've done a great job making me feel like family and welcomed. LPS student's CAN'T participate in Collegiate Sports, but club and intramural sports are up for grabs. I tried to join the Penn Crew(Rowing) Team, and trained with them for one month, and later found out that I didn't qualify under the NCAA bylaws. :-/ Coach was great about everything though. The Pottruck Fitness Center (one of Penn's Gym) is AWESOME!  As an undergrad student, you pay for it with student fees...so use it!\nI was accepted to 5 other Universities and 3 of them offered me decent scholarships. Penn ended up offering me the best aid package of them all, so it was a no brainer for me. The only downfall was the time lost from practically starting fresh again. I have to be in school an extra year because of the limited amount of transferred credits. I'm confident that my time spent here will be well worth it at the end. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. haha. One major reason that convinced me to come to Penn was the Bachelors Degree. At the end of the day, once I graduate, my diploma will say \"Bachelors of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania\". Just the name alone will separate myself from other schools/job applicants. I know it doesn't apply to all jobs, but most corporations and larger businesses are attracted to the Ivy League brand name.\nRemember, this is my personal experience. I hope this helps, and I wish the best of luck to you!

High school is long gone. Any thoughts on this???\nAlso weighing in on the GS vs LPS concerns: GS has Columbia's core curriculum. That may matter to some people, who just want to focus on their personal academic interests. The GS diploma is in English I think and the Columbia college of the arts is in latin, so you get two different looking diplomas. However: I have yet to hear of an employer asking to see a diploma. It really doesn't matter if it' sin english or latin. And from a grad school or employer's POV, it's a Columbia degree. People that I've know who have feet in both schools look at the degrees equally as the classes are the same. Harvard's extension school is not the same--different classes are given in the extension. But at GS the students take exactly the same classes if they want as the other students.

You typically need a 3.7-3.8 GPA in the College or SEAS, and you need to have taken courses to position you to jump into the Wharton core as soon as you start. Another reality is that the College is not tremendously easy to get into to start, certainly not substantially easier than Wharton. It isn't like you're looking at a university with one school that is desperate for applicants and another that is highly coveted by high school students. If Wharton's acceptance rate is 10% and the College's is 15%, that still means that more than 8 in 10 people who apply will not get in. Not worth the risk of applying to a program you don't actually want to finish with.\nWith all that said, if you are talking about majors within a school, Penn doesn't care at all.

The difference in acceptance rate between Wharton and the College is probably about the same as the difference between Stanford and Princeton or Harvard and MIT, which is to say, negligible. And the stats of the incoming students at Penn's undergrad schools are all comparable. Wharton students are encouraged to take and do well on Math SAT subject tests, whereas students in the College will have taken and done exceptionally well on any number of SAT subject tests, which may or may not include math. Additionally, there is no GPA requirement specific for a wharton internal transfer, it's all about showing why that curriculum would fit your interests better and ensuring that you are doing well enough at the university to make switching schools academically feasible. It's not about preventing a 'bait and switch' since getting into wharton is not harder than getting into the college or engineering (it's possible that Engineering's acceptance rate is now lower than Wharton's-- and acceptance rate doesn't dictate difficulty). You will need at least a 3.4 to switch to any school within Penn and more importantly, you will need a good reason why your academic interests are not being met in your current program with the added flexibility offered by Penn's liberal policies regarding taking classes in other schools at the University. The same goes for students moving out of Wharton. I knew a handful of kids that transferred both into and out of Wharton, and the only thing they had in common was a desire to study something else- otherwise their GPA's were anywhere between 3.4-4.0.\nThat being said, combining programs between Wharton and the college is very doable if you are interested in connecting both disciplines. You can take classes across Penn's undergrad, graduate, and professional schools thanks to the One University Policy and you can definitely do research across the whole school. It is an institution uniquely positioned to offer a student with interdisciplinary interests the opportunities and resources they need to pursue the education that best meets their needs. It sounds like you would greatly benefit from studying in the college or wharton and using the resources of the other to pursue your ultimate goals after graduation. good luck  ", "user_id": "100527187", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}, {"date": {"month": "August", "day": "14,", "year": "2016", "time": "3:16PM"}, "comment": "\nThank you so much!

Perhaps I've posted about it in the past when it was fresher in my memory? At the same time, i think that speaks to 2 things:\n1. Most people who want to switch are able to because they have genuinely good reasons for doing so and appropriate GPAs.\n2. Most penn students don't feel the need to internally transfer because the resources of each school are so readily available to students in other schools that it's not that important. If you want to study business but you're in engineering, then just take a lot of business courses! You'll still have access to the same career services and job opportunities. You can also partake in university-wide minors that combine the resources of several programs. For example, students love the consumer psych minor which combines classes and resources from Wharton and the College. Others enjoy the Legal Studies and History minor which again combines the College and Wharton. There is no need for 99.9% of students to be enrolled in one of the other schools to get what they need from Penn. And for the small percentage of students that feel they do need to switch schools, they are able to because they can easily demonstrate why their current school isn't in line with what they need academically.\nI think teacher recommendations are the most important part of your application.

Early in freshman year there was a decent bit of competitiveness, mainly because so many people are experiencing real academic competition for the first time.

It takes some longer than others, but eventually most people stop caring about how others are doing relative to themselves.

It may not seem to make sense, but there's a healthy realization that the first job out of college is a starting point.

It has easy access to NYC and Washington for the trifecta. While the campus is in Philadelphia, it sits across the river in the West Philly section and is slightly isolated in its own little bubble with a storybook like campus. West Philly is a lower income section of the city but has a strong neighborhood community and Penn tries to reach out and become a vital part in helping that community lots of ways to volunteer. The weather in Philly is more moderate and less snowy than Ithaca's climate. Ithaca is snowy and freezing in the winter - but has skiing nearby.\nCornell is located far from other major cites in upstate NY in a small city (top rated college town really) and is home to two big universities -so it has arts too through those schools but its not a real urban experience. It is known for its \"gorgeous\" scenery - so called bc there are several gorges, waterfalls, and green hills nearby. If you are an outdoorsy type it would be ideal probably for you. Philly also has some beautiful outdoor space along the Schuylkill river trail and parks so all is not lost if you are an outdoor lover and go to Penn...\nBoth are extremely competitive to get in (although Cornell is known as the easiest Ivy to get in).

A family friend's son just graduated and told stories of friends trying to sabotage each other with homework,tests, and papers.

Penn is competitive but also collaborative. People are immensely driven and hustle all the time for academics, extracurriculars, professional opportunities, internships etc. However you do see a lot of collaboration inside the classroom and outside too and there is no really any sabotaging going on between the students.

Further, as Penn now practices restrictive ED (you can't EA to any other private), the pool may be a little smaller, and applying ED will \"mean\" more - because the admissions office knows their is no chance your sights are also set on some other top private school.\nAdmissions counsel aside, Cornell is a bit of an under-appreciated school (similar to what Penn used to be around 15 years ago, and probably still continues to be today, in some circles). FWIW, Cornell still has one of the highest academic peer scores in US News (outside of the \"Big 5\" of Harvard et. al.) - I believe it's been around 4.6/5 - tied with Chicago, Columbia, Hopkins, and Cal Tech - for some time. Take that with a grain of salt but, for a long time, Cornell was seen as a rigorous, top-notch academic institution.\n(Full scores here: http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2013/02/28/which-universities-are-ranked-highest-by-college-officials)\nAll this to say I'm not sure why Cornell is so readily passed over. It does indeed have a rep for having a fairly intense academic atmosphere, but no more so than Chicago, MIT, Hopkins, etc. It also has broad, strong brand recognition, probably considerably more than Penn. (Note, Penn may have marginally better outcomes in some fields where it is more entrenched - like finance/consulting, but there seems to be more broad awareness about the Cornell brand). So, I'm always confused when students readily avoid Ithaca in favor of Hanover, or Providence, or Durham. (The Cornell v. Penn choice comes up less often, I imagine - the schools are in very different locations and have very different feels.)

Penn does not just have marginally better outcomes in some fields. Overall its graduate programs are stronger than Cornell's, has more financial resources and all this does trickle down to undergrad. For example at Penn one can easily conduct research at one of the very top hospitals and medical schools in the country and the world. Cornell does not offer this option given that its med school and hospital is in New York. At Penn an undergrad can take as many courses as they want at one of the top business schools in the country sometimes alongside MBA students, even if that student is not a wharton undergrad. A person can take law school classes at a top 10 law school or even sub matriculate into the JD program as an undergrad. There is a huge number of superstar professors in a variety of different fields at Penn who also get to teach undergrads. C\nPeer scores are highly subjective and a 0.01/0.02 difference between schools does not have a practically meaningful difference. Of course Cornell is an amazing school, and of course places like Penn or Chicago are not actually much more prestigious in any meaningful sense. But the stronger overall grad schools and the effect this has on undergrad departmental quality and also the smaller student body and more resources in undergrad, give them an edge over Cornell. The Cornell vs Penn choice actually does come up quite often, (the schools are actually very similar in many ways: both have greek life, both have a preprofessional culture, both have intense and competitive atmospheres etc) and the choice is overwhelmingly Penn.\nAll that said if Cornell is the first choice for someone, of course it makes sense to turn down Penn, Columbia, Chicago, even HYPSM for it. The school doesnt make the student and at Cornell the education is by no means at all inferior to the aforementioned schools. It will be up to the student to take advantage of the resources available. However for some well established reasons most people when faced with the choice have chosen the other over Cornell.\nLastly, Penn was not underrated until 17-18 years ago. There was good reason it was not considered as highly as today. It was actually lacking in certain areas, was not taking advantage of its resources correctly was not organized properly. Former president Judith Rodin saw that during her tenure all these things were addressed. As a result Penn's quality improved tremendously, it started becoming more savvy about marketing and the whole admissions game (much like Chicago in this respect) and as a result rose tremendously.

Even in this discussion board alone, you'll see people asking if Penn is confused with Penn State, or questioning the general brand awareness of the school. Search this board, and the Penn State v. Penn issue, or the question of \"Do people know Penn?\" comes up. I just haven't seen or heard of this as much with Cornell.\nNow, keep in mind, this doesn't mean much in terms of outcomes - schools like Williams and Haverford and Wash U probably don't have broad brand recognition, but they're all wonderful places. Cornell, to me at least, felt like a school that was somewhat of a known commodity broadly - in a way that Penn wasn't, at least in my experience being an alum. Again, I don't care about this, but I never understood how a school like Cornell, which, to me, had a lot of public cachet, then underperformed when it comes to admissions.\nRe the peer scores, my main point is that there is some \"stickiness\" to these scores, and Cornell generally outperforms Duke, Penn, Brown, Northwestern, etc. My sense is, however, that Cornell does NOT fare well in admissions against any of these schools. It's as well regarded as any of them (if not better), but there's a big gap in cross admit data. Further, it's unfortunate for cornell because this score is the hardest to change, and there's now a very strong correlation between this score and the rank of a school.\n(A quick side bar - as Johns Hopkins has started to play the rankings game, and it enjoys a strong peer score, it's starting to manipulate factors like admit rate and incoming student strength to begin its march into the top ten. This, by the way, puts Duke and Penn - the two top 10 schools with the weakest peer scores - at risk of dropping out of the top ten. A few years back, two other schools with the strongest peer scores - Chicago and Columbia - did the same thing, and this all has the net effect of punishing the schools without the best peer scores. Because of this, we've seen Duke and Penn essentially flip places with Columbia and Chicago, and it looks like Hopkins is pressing forward here too. Cornell can't, because, based on its size and land grant status, many of its programs are fixed - it has less flexibility than some of its smaller peers.)\nFinally, you mentioned that Penn's stronger grad schools, smaller student body, etc. give it an edge over Cornell. This may be the case, but I'm not sure if those factors are the most salient when determining strength of the undergraduate experience. Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, Hopkins, etc. all lack top flight professional schools (in Law, business) or top grad programs in some areas, for example, but they all handily win over cross-admits. Moreover, the benefits of a large school - the ability to tailor the experience more, avoid a homogenous school culture, etc. are significant. Being larger is one of Penn's strengths actually - and keep in mind that Penn has more students total than Cornell.\nTo sum, I have no real reason to back Cornell, but it just seems under-appreciated to me. It seems like just as good an option as Dartmouth, Brown, Duke, Penn, Northwestern (and probably Columbia and Chicago too) but my sense is it falls far short of these other peers in the college admissions game.\nOn that note, I'm surprised to hear that it has lots of competition with Penn - the locations seem so different. I thought Cornell would have more overlap with top land-grant schools (like U. of Michigan), and possibly research Us in more isolated areas (like Duke, Wash U, or possibly Northwestern, even though NU is close to Chicago).

People who are college football fans and are not really familiar with elite schools (apart from the obvious ones Harvard, Stanford, MIT etc) probably will not know Penn but chances are they won't know any of the other schools either.\nPrinceton might not have professional schools like Medicine, Law, Business, but it does have some of the best graduate programs in the world. All the schools you mention win cross admits in my opinion because people weigh in both the strength of graduate programs and the undergrad teaching quality, size of undergrad population, distribution of resources. I do think strength of graduate programs trickles down to undergrad because it affects to a great degree departmental quality and research opportunities. As the paradigm shifts away from plain liberal arts to a combination of liberal arts and pre professionalism, graduate program quality becomes more and more relevant, especially at a place like Penn that is small enough for professors to have meaningful interactions with students. Penn is large enough to offer a diverse experience but not too large to feel too overwhelming and for resources to be diluted across a vast undergraduate student body.\nAlso I don't think Columbia or Chicago and especially Chicago are in some way above Penn or even Duke, just because in the last few years they have been ranking higher than Penn. (For many years before than Penn was higher). The cross-admit split, overall and RD yield rate, number of major scholarships (Rhodes, Marshall etc) , career, grad school outcomes, relative departmental qualities as a whole etc, do not support this.\nOn the other hand I think there is a slight difference between Columbia, Penn, Chicago and also Duke vs Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell, NW.\nBtw yeah Cornell and Penn are definitely similar not in term of location of course, but in man y ways in terms of culture and atmosphere.

(3.9-4.0 UW)/(99th percentile SAT score - though took SAT's 3x)/(750+ SAT's in Math 2, a science, and US History)\nOther academics: Class Top 10, National Merit Semi, etc. Course schedule very loaded.

Nothing too outstanding though.\nEC's:\n>Not related to Science and Business: Violin - Nationally Recognized; Three season athlete (soccer - [team nationally ranked], winter track+spring track). Art - [scholastic art award gold key winner], Various but not hardcore Volunteer stuff (tutoring, benefit concerts), Chess club (meh), contributor to school newspaper and magazine.\n>Related to Science and Business (Their website seems to like kids who have more science activities; not sure if I have enough):\nInterned at a Lab at UPenn last summer(have a rec from the head director too), DECA member (Business Club - only made it to states though due to conflicts), NSLC (1 summer - national student leadership conference entrepreneurship incubator, my team won the product pitch competition?), Econ Club member, Astronomy Club + Reincarnation/UFOology club (just started with my friend, so this means probably nothing to the admissions officer)\n>Leadership positions (don't seem too legit though):\nOrganizer of the Benefit Concerts and Hospital Visits\nConcertmaster and Section Leader positions in various orchestras\nOfficer (but not founder..) in two clubs at school\n>Hooks:\nURM or Legacy: Nope.\nSchool: Yes. Independent school in PA with very good connection to UPenn. We feed lots of kids there.

There are so many kids with perfect SATs at LSM. The average SAT at LSM is around 2310 (for comparison the average SAT for Penn overall is 2200). So when you say 99th percentile, you need to be more specific. A 2220 score is within the 99th percentile but this is lower than the median Penn SAT(2230) and you almost definitely won't get into LSM with a 2220. Also the average incoming class GPA at Penn is 3.94. I m pretty sure 99% of LSM kids have absolute perfect GPAs, and the ones who don't are either international or have some other super hook, wow factor. LSM kids on top of perfect or near perfect grades and SATs also have a wow factor which I do not really see in your stats. The Penn Lab work and recommendation might help tho. I think you should def apply cause your profile is within the feasible range.\nOut of curiosity what is your second choice after Penn LSM? (since you said you don't wanna do CAS or Wharton alone). On that note however, if you want you can apply to Wharton and then once you get in you can apply to do an uncoordinated dual degree with the College.

Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.\n2. The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?\n3. Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?\n4. Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.\n5. Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.\nSo I have two topics in mind. One was about this infomercial channel that I discovered why roaming the channels while watching TV. I think this channel greatly inspired me to want to become a business woman/entrepreneur. Another idea I had is writing about how my brother inspired me to do well in school/life. My brother got into UPenn and went there for his undergraduate but now he's not working or anything.

Once you have the requirements to apply, if your GPA is above the cutoff, then you get in, otherwise you don't.\nWhat I think is unfair about this is precisely what JCoveney mentions -- the rigor of the courseload. By basing the decisions on just GPA, they are basically saying: \"if you really want to get into Wharton, do everything you can to have a high GPA.\" I could've taken 4 (easy) classes first and second semesters (4.5 cu's) and have a much greater chance of getting a GPA above 3.7 or whatever. But instead, I decided to challenge myselft by taking 5.5 cu's and 6.0 cu's, respectively, including some not very easy subjects, and now all my chaces of applying for a Dual Degree are gone. Crude GPA is definitely not the best criterion, if you asked me.\nwell if you think it's unfair, then apply to Jerome Fisher M&T program instead =D.

Although, are you sure there is an 'official' cutoff? I had the impression that for M&T, as long as you had a GPA above 3.4, then you apply, and applications are judged holistically after that (of course you would probably need a very high GPA to have a chance, but that is because of how competitive the program is).

Personally, I did not because 1) My first interest was always engineering; 2) I didn't even seriously considered and/or researched Wharton when I applied; 3) I did not know enough about the Dual application process in order to 'discover' that applying to Wharton first is a better strategy. Still, even if 3) was not a reason, I wouldn't have applied to Wharotn in the first place; if your interest and first priority has always been engineering, applying to a business school may just feel 'weird'.\nWould it really be much fairer to have someone arbitrarily decide whether one class (or two or three or four) is more difficult than another that a different student is taking? How can you compare that many classes and that many applications? And based on what?\n\n\nWell, this is precisely the issue, but I think there are some ways in which the courseload and classes can be taken into account. I don't feel like proposing something serious now, but I mean, if you look at class averages or some other grade statistics, I think it would be 'clear' that it is harder to get an A in Chem or Phys than it is in Econ or Philosophy... I don't want to get into a harsh debate here... Also, I think engineers in general have a harder courseload than college students (I'm not saying this is a fact, but I think many people, including college students, would agree), but nevertheless, this is not currently taken into account, as Engineering Dual Degree Applications, College Dual Degree Applications, and Internal Transfer from College Applications are all considered within the same pool. Note: it may appear that I'm throwing this 'College rant' at legendofmax, but please don't take it personal. I seriously congratulate you for getting into Wharton.\nI think you are much better off with them judging just your GPA than them judging you like they would freshmen applications. Because then hardly anyone would get in. Would that be a better option for you?\n\n\nBut why do you assume that by looking at other things besides GPA, then it is harder to get in? Basically if they keep the 'you need at least 3.4 for your application to be considered' requirement, but instead eliminate any further cutoffs and also ask for a personal statement or something, then the number of applicants wouldn't change by that much, and people with GPA's below 3.7 would stand a chance.\nSorry, but it annoys me when people complain about how hard it is to get into Wharton after you're already at Penn.\n\n\nI'm not really complaining about how hard it is to get in; I'm discussing the fairness of their current selection method and the possibility of using other criteria. Maybe it is the same thing, but oh well...\nIf that's what you wanted then you should have applied straight to Wharton in the first place. And if you think it's unfair then imagine how much harder it would be for everyone if they used more than just GPA.\n\n\nWell, Wharton is not what I wanted. And again, you assume that if they use more than GPA then it's harder. Why?\nIf anything you should be happy.\n\n\nI'm not happy, I'm not sad. The intention of my original question was mere curiosity -- I wanted to see what everyone else had to say about the issue. Probably my posts after the first question (and this post, too), seem like a rant from a poor engineer who will not be able to get into Wharton, but really, it's not that I'm angry or anything. I always saw the possibility of a Dual degree with Wharton as an 'aggregate value' to my engineering education and as an interesting intellectual challenge, but definitely not as the beginning and end of all things.\nWow, this post is long.

As for classes -- it is not necessarily harder in one class or another. Science/math/physics/and especially CS is my forte (I helped my Engineering roommate with a majority of his homework) but I am not going for an engineering degree of any kind. It is challenging to do well in already-challenging classes where everyone else does well because then the standards are much higher in a tough subject. It really depends on your strengths. This is why it's hard for Penn to evaluate rigor given such a small record. But yes for engineers it is probably the hardest because I think they have the lowest average GPA? It's a little harsh since a lot of the subject matter has a clear-cut answer to most of it. I mean look at Math 104 -- people get slaughtered even in that class, and the Engineers have to take a lot more classes like this. Anyways thanks for the congratulations -- btw are you AT? I think you lived down the hall from me in Hill.\nAs for your statement about the 3.4 vs 3.7 thing... mind you the GPA thing is not some number they set. They go in descending GPA order for as many seats that are available. So if a bunch of 4.0 students applied for 15 spots, the 3.9 person may not even get a chance. The reason why the M&T cutoff is so high is because there are so few people who drop M&T (cough cough JCo), making room for other people. Thus the ones who get the limited slots are the ones with the killer GPAs. They add the other requirements (recs, etc) because they want to discourage people from transferring in since it is indeed a hard program and they don't want just anyone getting in, I think.\nThe reason why adding more criterions in addition to \"GPA\" would make it harder is simply that in itself -- it makes it harder -- there are more possible criterions for one to fail at. I don't know how they can fix this other than adding a sort of interview process, eliminating those that were obviously just backdooring. Thing is, everyone's in Penn already so we already passed the test of the admissions officers. It's kind of difficult to pull anything more from a fresh start in college since all we really have is GPA. Some people from high school get higher starts in college because they have credit from high school or came from better schools, etc (like I had to take 104 because I simply did not have the credit -- high school didn't offer it and I couldn't take the AP/IB for it) and so it would be questionable to add in course rigor especially since everyone has different skills. I'm personally very happy about Wharton because I felt like I really earned it -- I've had a lot on my plate that most people don't have to deal with and I feel like this symbolizes a start to something good.\nAnyways if you wanted to apply for a dual I am sure it is still possible mathematically -- it is always good to keep options open.

By using a numerical quantity there's really no room for argument, whereas you can imagine the clamor there would be from dissatisfied students if the administration had arbitrarily assigned \"difficulty ratings\" to classes.\nthe engineering cirriculum DOES make it very difficult to maintain the average. Chem 053 really hurt my GPA, but what incoming SEAS freshman who want to keep their options open should do is minimize engineering only classes. I kept enough options open so that I could go wherever I wanted when I figured out what I wanted to do exactly.\nSo, I took the required math and sciences (can't really progress in engineering without 'em): 114/240, chem101, phys 152 (had credit for 151). The only engineering class I took was EAS101 which i really regret doing. I didn't learn much from the class and all it did was lower my GPA. The rest of my classes were econ, writing, & stat. I did have the minimum base required if I was going to stick with just engineering, but I also took an easier course that I was interested in (stat111) instead of the engineering class.\nSo the real key for any incoming freshmen is to plan your schedule based on what you want to do at penn. If you are planning on getting 2 degrees or you have a sudden change of interest during your first semester, make sure you plan your schedule taking into account:\n1. You might not get in. Plan your schedule so that you're not screwed over in your home school if that happens.\n2. Keep your schedule flexible. Especially if you're planning a transfer, use up a lot of your distribution/free credits on courses that will work towards your second school's requirements.\n3. Postpone the more difficult courses. This might strike some as trying to \"game the system\" but since that's the way things work you might as well accept it. Take the \"soft\" class that strikes you as interesting but will also boost your grades. Use up some of your free credits.\nHowever don't place all your hopes on the second school. It's only going to get harder and harder to get a second degree from Wharton as more and more people apply as freshman. The school you're in now is the one you applied to anyway and is probably flexible enough.

I think you lived down the hall from me in Hill.\n\n\nI just sent you a PM.\nAbout adding more criteria other than GPA, well, you are correct in that there are more possible ways in which you can 'fail', but it also opens the opportunity to students who really have strong reasons for applying but whose GPA doesn't meet the cutoff for that year (but it's still competitive). It also helps to spot backdoor applicants, as you said. Maybe they could also separate pools, ie make an Engineering pool, and a College pool, and offer places according to the number of College/Engineering applicants (this based on the hypothesis that engineers' load, in general, is harder, and that their average GPA is, as you said, lower). An application with more requirements may even reduce the number of applicants (because now it takes more work to apply), and perhaps stop some kids who think along the lines of 'Cool, I got a 3.8 GPA, so maybe I'm going to apply for a Dual degree with Wharton and see what happens. After all, I just need to submit a form, and I will probably get in. I don't lose anything and I gain the Wharton prestige.'\nAnyways if you wanted to apply for a dual I am sure it is still possible mathematically -- it is always good to keep options open\n\n\nWell, funnily enough, it's not possible mathematically! If I get straight A's in all of sophomore year, my GPA doesn't even reach 3.6 (from this you can probably infer that my GPA kind of sucks, ;p). For it to reach 3.6/3.7, I would have to take a ridiculous amount of credit units and get A's in all of them. The only option is that, I get straight A's all of sophomore year, and somewhow the cutoff at the end of Spring 2007 is really low. But for this, I need to take Acct101/102, and Stat430/431 (or ESE301/302), and I'm not sure if 'spending' those 4 cu's is worth it considering the very very small chance I have.\nMichaelJ, the advise you give is certainly wise.

You should not have a problem with the schedule because if you're interested in Wharton then most likely you're going to take Econ anyway and so it isn't so much an issue for such students. It really hurts the people who have to go out of their way to take transfer-necessary courses, which it should. I took OPIM because I figured it was a \"test of last resort\" -- if I got a bad grade in it and it kept me from being able to transfer, then it was probably for the best. But I liked OPIM and I like a lot of the business/math classes and so I was more sure of transferring.\nI think your idea of separating pools is a wonderful idea though. That would be a good way to gauge GPA. The only drawback is that sometimes you might get an engineer who takes very few rigorous engineering courses but gets the advantage of having a more lenient cutoff. This was probably taken into account and is why the system is as it is now.

But, like someone else said, it is impossible for Wharton to regulate what courses SEAS students take and you know that there will be SEAS students who won't take any engineering classes with the intention to transfer out.

I mean, regular admissions applications are propense to this kind of complaining, too. They can just say \"All decisions are final, we don't reconsider applications, we can't tell you why you didn't get in, period. (sue us if you want to, and then we'll tell you why you didn't get in.)\". Basically any decision process that isn't based in totally objective criteria has this problem, but this doesn't mean every process should be changed to numerical, crude criteria just so that there are no objections to the decisions.\nThe reason why I said it would be harder to consider applications the way they do freshmen applications (not just adding additional criteria) is that they look at things like leadership and high school performance.

Just because someone passed the test of admission for SEAS/COL/NURS does not mean they would have gotten into WH as all the schools value different things more than others.\n\n\nI agree with the 'schools look for different things' part and with the fact that it is possible that some people who got into SEAS/SAS/Nursing would not have gotten into Wharton (in reality, we never know what would have happened with any specific candidate). However, in this case, there are a limited number of available spaces, and I think the objective would still be to fill up all those places. Chances are the admissions commitee will still find enough qualified applicants to fill in those places. As long as the number of applicants doesn't suddenly increase by a lot, I would't say the difficulty of getting in would change significantly (the applicaton would require more things, tough).\nBut, like someone else said, it is impossible for Wharton to regulate what courses SEAS students take and you know that there will be SEAS students who won't take any engineering classes with the intention to transfer out.\n\n\nThis is precisely why I'm suggesting that the courseload of the applicant is looked at by someone. If there is an Engineering applicant that hasn't taken any engineering class, then this would be taken into account in the admissions decisions (chances are the candidate is, as you say, a backdoor applicant.)\nI don't know. I guess I agree that it's not totally fair, but still think it's the best that they can actually do.\n\n\nYeah, I mean, maybe it's better if they leave it that way...

I studied in a Trust School in Pakistani educational system my whole life. It is a very low quality educational system where you just got to memorize whatever your teacher writes on the blackboard. We memorized entire essays, theories even Math Concepts. No one will ever try to explain anything or try to make you be clear enough on concepts to write the answers yourself. Just memorize it and write it off in exams.\nI wasn't just the top of my class. I was the School Topper in that system... I would score Highest Percentage scorer in entire secondary section throughout class 6 and 7.\nNow as it happens, there were only two options available for me to study. I could be a doctor or an engineer. But, I didn't want to be either of those. I wasn't happy with the way I was being taught. I was already scoring the highest in my entire school but I still wasn't learning any worthwhile stuff. So I took the hardest and craziest decision that a 13 year old could make.\nI dropped out of school and decided to take a curriculum that I couldn't afford. It is the A Level Cambridge affiliated matriculation system that only the richest could afford. I was the poorest. My Father had abandoned me and my mother after he tried to kill her before she could give birth to me. We lived with our grand parents and two aunts.\nSo the only way left for me to do was to try to take this on myself. I bought second hand cheap books and started to teach myself. From my local education to this international one, it was a huge jump. I had no reading/analytical/ or heck, even linguistic skills. I couldn't speak a sentence of English, how was I supposed to write explanatory essays in it. I couldn't take a lot of Advanced Courses but that is because I had to take this journey without a teacher by my side which I hope will be considered by Universities.\nGrades: O Level (9,10,11th Year): | Urdu: A, English Language: A, Math: A*, Economics: A*, Business Studies: A, Commerce: A* |\nA Level (12, 13th year): | Economics A, Business Studies: A, Math: C (3 papers in 1 day)|\nGraduation date: 13 January 2016\nJob/ Work Experience: I am working since I am 13, in order to finance my exam registration fees. I had to do every low paying Freelance job online. I did ghost writing, Translations. I wrote a lot of employee handbooks, product descriptions, Taglines. I worked with a firm as a CV, LinkedIn Profile and Cover Letter writer. I even wrote Masters coursework for people so I could pay my fees\nExtra-curricular: As you can imagine, I was never offered them. I loved debating but there aren't any MUNS in Pakistani Trust Schools. I spend any free time I have in learning about Security Analysis/ Investment Banking or Music Production/ Djing.\nOther Activities: Heavy Family responsibilities.. My family was a mess after my mother's divorce as that stopped my aunts from getting married in our conservative society. I posed as my grand father and found them grooms through matrimonial etc. I also made my mother remarry. She happened to marry a person in US and brought me here with her last month\nSAT: As per practice results: Above 1500 / 1600\nSAT subjects: My finances doesn't allow me to give those.\nIncome Bracket: $25000 for 3 People in family + 4th person Child support\nStep Father is sole earner, no work permits for me or my mother yet\nCommon App Essay: I plan to write about my life's circumstances here a bit\nWharton Essay: I Plan to write about some of my own deduced business theories and a future business plan based on those with aim of removing financial gap in society through a Social corporate responsibility accepting and Profit reinvesting banking institution that operates in a certain way, creation of an accompanying education system and use of external economies of scale etc and something about my passion of music business, as I want to use my education in more than one ways.\nCounselor Recommendation: My mother will have to write it, she is a Masters in Education so she can define my methods of studying, (Extensive Book and Internet study on topic, Then Use of Past questions as guidelines of testing knowledge and writing as much as I know in answer of every question to reinforce the knowledge, and working on exam answering technique as third step). She can also share some insights on my family duties, the way she brought me up etc)\nTeacher Recommendation: My Aunt. she is the one who made everything possible, she is teaching me since I am 3 year old, and she can tell them about the way I have been..\nMy 6/7 Grade English teacher, she practically cried the day I left school.. She loved me and she is an English teacher so I am expecting something decent\nOther Recommendation: My main Free Lance work provider, who was shocked when he learnt that the person doing all the corporate environment inquires was 15 years old. He knows my family situations and hardships I have been through.\nState: GA\nGender: F\nAge: 18 going on 19 right now \nHooks: Umm Father was Doctor, Mother is M.ED, Step Father is high school, all from Pakistan.. No one have US Education yet\nThank you so much for your time, if you read all that.. I know that Universities are very unpredictable, but I just want you to look at this profile and remember that Ivies like to build a diverse class, but are competitive like hel.\nAnd just give me your intuitive reaction..\nCan I make it?

You are going to have to make a sincere effort to convey what you did in the context of the culture you lived in and what your actions mean.\nYour life circumstances do make a compelling common app story.\nHave you looked at the essay prompt for Penn yet? The essay isn't \"What are your business plans\" but \"How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania?\" This requires you to really research and understand the school, and understanding for example what degrees each school offers would be a start.\nDo you have anything to show for the thing you learned on the side? any projects etc.? Those count as extracurriculars.\nYou should not use your family to write your reccomendations. Your counselor should be the counselor from the school you attended, if you don't have one then you can ask Penn Admissions if that rec is really neccesary. Do not use your aunt. Find another teacher that liked you and can write about you.\nAre you technically an international applicant? If you are prepare to have to take out loans. You cannot expect financial aid and asking for financial aid might get you rejected.\nWhat does wrote Masters coursework mean? does that mean you helped design masters level classes? if so that could be an interesting extracurricular.\nWork does count as extracurricular btw.\nUltimately, you have a chance, you certainly have a compelling story, but you need to seriously polish your application and make sure that the person reading your application can immediately understand what you went through without any confusion and can understand your application and your story. Keep in mind this person is very likely not at all someone that can relate to you and yet you still need them to understand in the limited space you have. You also have to convey better that you truly understand penn and what you are applying for, and that means starting with the understanding the degree offered to understanding how the coursework is, understanding the curriculum, understanding what it means to be a part of the greater penn community (not just wharton), one university policy, resources offered, etc etc etc. all that will play into the why penn essay,, and showing you get what this is about will help you significantly in your application process.

Legacy will definitely help you in ED, as Penn directly states this on their admissions page. My only advice to you at this point is to just focus on your essays, as they will be what tip you over into acceptance. When writing your Why Penn essay, don't just focus on what makes Penn appealing to you; remember to show the admissions committee how you will contribute as an individual to the School of Engineering and Penn's class of 2021.\nAlso, some parting advice from a graduated senior/rising college freshman: don't stress out too much! So many things are out of your hands during the admissions process. Don't let college admissions rule over your head; it'll ruin your entire senior year. Enjoy this last year you have with all of your friends and family! It's so easy to get swept up in the college craze, especially as deadlines approach or decisions start coming out. Be happy for your friends who get into their top schools, but don't forget that there are many others who received not so good news as well. I fell victim to the stress and pressure surrounding senior year, and looking back on it now, it was really foolish of me; I would have enjoyed myself a lot more if I had just put college out of mind as soon as I hit the submit button. One of my alumni interviewers (I think it was actually my Penn interviewer!) gave me the best, albeit cliched, piece of advice: everything will truly work out in the end. Although getting rejected/waitlisted from your dream school may seem like the end of the world, you will ultimately end up where you will be happy.

Penn is not worrying about losing kids to just MIT or Chicago. They are worried about losing kids to HYPS.\nAnd allowing kids to apply to MIT and/or UChicago EA may be fueling this problem for them.\nA certain number of students may be using the \"financial aid not enough\" escape hatch and an admit from a school like UChicago or MIT as a safety parachute to go after the most prestigious college they can get into. They can now bail from Penn and try to get into HYPS at Penn's expense. If everything else fails, they still land at a good school. These kids may be applying to Penn just to boost their admission chances even if it is not their absolute top choice because they really don't want to risk an SCEA application to HYPS. So they choose an Ivy like Penn with a relatively high ED admit rate in the hopes that they will make it in. It's a risk mitigation strategy in an admission environment where there is too much unpredictability in where a student might get admitted.\nFor such kids, using the finance escape hatch right after they get a nod from an MIT or UChicago is a way to have their cake and eat it too. They can't just apply EA to these schools. The admit rate for EA schools is not close to the 23%-25% at a school like Penn (Yeah, I know that the real admit rate for unhooked candidates may be lower, but these students may not realize that). Once they get an admit from a top 10 school, they could go school shopping for even more prestige by throwing a Hail Mary pass at HYPS. They can't do that now. Penn just took away their parachute. Now a student would have to think really carefully if they want to turn down their ED acceptance. If they turn it down, they have so safety net in case they get rejected at HYPS.\nFor whatever reason, Penn is finding that their ED pool is not giving them a near 100% yield. Prestige shopping by some students using the EA admit safety net may be the reason.\nOf course, I am just speculating here, but I can't think of any other rational reason to bar the EA applications.

I'm an alum of both Chicago and Penn, and I assure you that no significant \"insider\" information is shared between admissions offices and their general alumni base. I've called both admissions offices in the past, and attended info sessions for both schools, and only receive the company line. Some scraps of information _may_ be shared with either students or those with higher levels of access to alumni admissions committees (of which I have none). That's why I posted here - seeking posters who have this info.@VeryLuckyParent makes a good point - that prestige-chasing students may turn down Penn for MIT or Chicago early (as these three schools are all at about the same level, or, in some circles, Chicago and MIT are more coveted), and THEN these students take a stab at Harvard et. al RD. The problem with this analysis, though, is that the numbers don't back it up. Any given year, there are what, maybe 6 or 7 students TOTAL who play this game? It doesn't seem like enough to create a policy with negative buzz.\nI'm still baffled by the change, and it drops Penn's admissions office in my eyes. I was a significant opponent to ED generally, and having RESTRICTIVE ED is just worse. Further, it just weakens the quality of the ED pool, all to chase what, a 0.3% bump in ED yield?\nThe cynic in me says that, yes, Penn is that prestige-conscious and that concerned about yield that they're willing to make such a negative, restrictive move. They are so frightened of losing the 3-4 kids to MIT, and the 1-2 kids to Chicago in the ED round each year, that they're willing to create a new policy to bump up yield, at the COST of a less talented ED applicant pool. It smacks of bad gamesmanship. To me, it makes Chicago (with EA, and ED1 and ED2) and Penn (with restrictive ED) the worst in terms of admissions practices.\nThis may be a by-product of both schools being arguably the most insecure when it comes to admissions at this level. As opposed to MIT (or Columbia, or Stanford), these two schools are relative newcomers to ultra-competitive admissions. Penn only became selective at the top run 10-12 years ago, and at Chicago, it's only been at this level for 4-5 years.\nOn the flip side, kudos to MIT and Cal Tech for refusing to play the game!

Also Penn s financial aid is as good as MIT and Chicago -- but then again Chicago has merit scholarships which changes things (but how many students would that affect?).\nI really disagree with your post regarding internationals, given that I am kind of one, in the sense that while American i mostly grew up and finished high school abroad. It is true that outside the US, Harvard/MIT/Stanford are the top dream schools. Next comes Yale, Princeton. Next tier Columbia/Penn/Chicago. It is very true that most international students are very prestige-focused (and understandably so, they are making a big move leaving their country so they seek the security of a globally super-strong brand). An international student with competitive stats simply will not even think about committing ED to a school like Penn, unless Penn is their number one choice (and there are quite a few intl students who do have Penn as their first choice). An international dreaming of Harvard will apply SCEA to Harvard to maximize their chances at Harvard, and then leave the rest for ED. Plus the vast majority of them do not apply for financial aid so there is no way they could break the ED contract at Penn.\nThe only feasible explanation I can find is that Penn wants to limit the ED pool to people who absolutely, 150% have Penn as their first choice. It seems petty to me but maybe they are moving in this direction to further rationalize accepting the majority of the class ED and further legitimize the yield which hit 68-69% this year. I really don't think it is gonna affect the quality of the ED applicants in any significant way. Yeah Penn might get a few hundred fewer ED apps but not much will chance imo.@Cue7 I think you are right about Penn and Chicago. I would argue Penn entered the just-below-HYPSM top game 16-17 years ago at the very end of the 90s, after the vast reforms under judith rodin started having a tangible effect on the school. For Chicago it has been the last 4-5 years of really rising through the ranks of the whole prestige-rankings game. So yeah I would agree thaT these two schools are probably the most conscious of their standing. Columbia has been part of the top game for a long time, throughout the 20th century.

When yield was factored into the rankings Penn was able to be in the top 5, but since usnews stopped using it, Penn has been relegated to the lower half of the top 5. Also it is part of Penn's identity to admit more well-rounded people or people with amazing ECs (company founders, charities etc) who might have competitive but not amazing SATs which then results in lower average SATs, which is similar to Stanford s philosophy. I don't think Penn is willing to sacrifice that by admitting more of the bookish, nerdy high SAT kids at the expense of what it thinks are more interesting people, so maybe it is looking for ways to improve its ranking through lowering acceptance rate.\nAnd I can't say I blame them, I don't see any legitimate reason why Penn should be ranked lower than Columbia or Chicago. This year Penn ranked #9, the first time it has held a position that low in almost 20 years, so it might have been a wake-up call to action. This isn't a reflection of deterrioration in quality or any other issue, Penn has been going from strength to strength in all areas. It is just that the ranking criteria don't favor Penn as much so i guess they feel that some changes needs to be made. StillI don't see how this new policy will have a meaningful impact on the acceptance rate though.\nI think what Penn needs to do is lower the class size by 400-500 people and they should be fine. Not just to make the acceptance rate more competitive, but just in general I think Penn is slightly too big for an ivy, a class size of 1900-2000 would be ideal.
