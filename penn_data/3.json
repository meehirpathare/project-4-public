I would suggest that you really work hard on your essays so you can distinguish yourself from everybody else who also have strong stats. Your esssays will definitely need to be better than averagish  When writing your essays make sure you convey specific examples about Penn that excite you. Maybe it is a certain class or a certain club or a certain research project and then tie it back to the extracurriculars you have done at your high school. You need to make sure your essays are unique for the Penn campus and what you can do there that you wouldn't be able to do at any other college. They want to see that you have a passion for Penn and a real desire to be there. They don't want to read a generic essay that could be used for any of your other college applications. Also, you should have someone read over your essays before you submit them. Maybe an English teacher at your school? Also, LORs are pretty important. Do yu have someone who could write you a strong LOR? Are you sure the other ones are just averagish?\nUnfortunately, I don't know anything about the LSM program. My son is a current freshman in the Wharton M&T program and loves Penn. I wish you the best of luck with your college applications and senior year!

However, my stats are a little shaky.\n- I have a 4.2 W and 3.63 UW GPA. I just took my SAT yesterday so I am unsure of what score I'll send, but most likely it will range from 1350-1420. I took 2 subject tests: Math 2 (740) and Korean (800).\n- My mother had uterine fibroids with a tumor of around 15 cm and had to leave to Korea to get surgery, where all her family members were. With my dad working full-time, I had to take care of the household and my baby sister while balancing that out with school for half a year. Additionally, to help support my family financially, I had to work for a year. I most definitely learned to be independent and viewed the world with a more mature lens, but unfortunately, the workload at school (I was taking APs) overwhelmed me, and I failed to balance out my role as a \"mother figure\" at home and a \"student\" at school. This led me to my diagnosis of an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia), which haunted me until the summer of this year. Fortunately, I have recovered and am more than motivated to pursue my goals as a child psychologist.\n- I had a lot of extracurriculars that revolved around children:\n1) Tutoring children (5 years)\n2) Teaching at 3 different children education institutions (8 1/2 years if I add the number of years I participated for each)\n3) Volunteered at a disability center (2 years)\n4) Club member of a school club that helps children with disabilities\n5) Co-president of my school's anti-human trafficking club\n5) Secretary of a big community service club outside of school (3 years)\n6) Work experience (1 year)\n7) Fundraised for 2 months for each place listed to buy clothes, toys, etc and contribute and volunteer in the following areas: Arizona Hopi Indian Village, Dominican Republic, Mexico, etc. (funded by the program I was involved in)\n- I got a few awards:\n1) First Place at Piano Competition in Colburn School of Music\n2) Recognized as the top student in a certain academy on behalf of the 68th CA Assembly District\n3) Presidential Volunteer Service Award (Gold- 4 years throughout highschool)\n4) Recognized for \"exemplary and outstanding dedication\" to my outside club by the Vice Chair of County of Orange, Second District\n5) National Honors Society at my school\n6) Principle Honor roll of CSF (CA Scholarship Federation)\n- My dream is to become a child psychologist and major in either child development, developmental child psychology, or general psychology (depending on what the school offers)\n- I believe my essays and teacher recs are pretty strong and I am determined to move onto college, serve the community by making a nonprofit organization for unprivileged ppl, but my stats are like totally demolishing my hopes and dreams. I mainly want to go to UPenn because of their high ranking in psychology most importantly their 4 college, 1 university system, where I am able to pursue my passion through my major but uplift and continue my interests (liberal arts/philosophy) by taking minors and ultimately apply all the critical thinking/knowledge I learned from my major and the broadened understanding of the world and human nature that I learned from my minor to strengthen the person I am and further stabilize my path to becoming a child psychologist.

Your stats look pretty good, but I'm sure you realize Wharton is very competitive and most applicants will have similar stats/ECs to yours (or maybe even better).

You might want to consider volunteering with a youth baseball team in your area....then you would have leadership and volunteering/ giving back to your community. If not that, then volunteering somewhere in your community if possible.\nThe other thing I highly suggest is doing a lot of research on the Wharton program and UPenn in general so that when you go to write your essays you can discuss various things that are unique to UPenn and why you really want to go there. You need to make sure you are highlighting things about UPenn and that your essay doesn't sound generic for any other \"USA college\".\nMy son will be attending UPenn this fall and was accepted to the M&T program in Wharton.

Wharton loves people who are interested in business and you seem to have a profile that fits that really well. In your essays make sure to play up your business credentials.\nThe biggest piece of advice that I can give you is to really spend a lot of time on your \u201cWhy Penn/Wharton\u201d essay. Try to give admissions a picture of how you would spend your four years at the university and take advantage of the unique programs at Wharton.

As a result you will be more likely to get into one of the top schools that you have ranked; especially with your stats and experiences, you will be a very solid applicant in QB. The caveat is, if you have your heart set on Wharton but you match with Brown, you\u2019d have to attend Brown.\nAs a former admissions counselor, I\u2019d say that your chances of matching with a Top 10 school through QB are very high.

I suspect you want a research internship mainly because it would look good on your college applications. However, the question is what could *you* do for the professor, not what *they* could do for you. So, pursuing a research internship as a long shot, you'll need to describe in some detail what area you want to research, what involvement you already have with it, and then contact the professor(s) who specialize in that area. Finding out which professors they are will be part of your familiarization with the subject.\nThe high school intern I had in Summer 2017 had started a club about an area I needed research on, and he was already very knowledgeable about it. So all I had to do was point him in the general direction of the work I wanted from him, and he knew how to do it.

Students who flourish at Wharton and Penn possess a history of academic excellence, a healthy degree of motivation, and a well-developed interest and involvement in their environment.\nWhile there is no magic formula, we are looking for students who have:\nAn interest in business to fuel positive change to advance the world\u2019s economic and social well-being\nDemonstrated leadership\nStrong preparation in mathematics, particularly calculushttps://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/UG_viewbook_2017_FNL.pdf\nIn terms of your application, I recommend that you focus on highlighting what you have done rather than on what you may not have done. If you want to attend Wharton and are in the academic range for the school put in your application and give it your all -- but recognize that the school is a reach for any unhooked applicant so be sure to also apply to match and safety schools that appear affordable and that you would be excited to attend.

One thing that an admissions person at Penn told me junior year is to DEFINITELY take BC calculus if your high school offers it.\nIn high school I did not have a large amount of business EC\u2019s, but I did have a significant amount of leadership and a strong interest in business (specifically real estate). Wharton really looks for students who are going to be impactful on campus and after graduation. Try to find activities you are passionate about and pursue leadership in them. Your essays do not have to be related to your EC\u2019s at all. My Common app was about my love of real estate and my Why Penn/Wharton essay discussed how I could use the resources at Penn/Wharton to explore how to develop businesses that would bring more equity to neighborhoods facing gentrification.\nWharton is basically looking for you to show them why their incoming class would not be complete without you. Spend a significant amount of time on your Why Penn/Wharton essay. Tell a story about how you see yourself thriving during your time on campus and beyond. If you took the words \u201cPenn/Wharton\u201d out of your essay, you should still be able to say that \u201cthis essay is for Penn.\u201d If you can\u2019t that means that you are being too generic.

It looks as if you have a great shot on getting into Penn as a transfer. I have a close friend who currently attends Lehigh and he finds it academically rigorous. If I may ask, why do you have the need to transfer? What are your reasons?\nAlso, hello all. I'm currently a sophomore attending a community college as a Political Science major in Southern New Jersey. This past semester, I took five classes (16 credits) and was able to finish the term off with a 3.75 GPA. As of now, I have around 42 credits under my belt and I'm hoping to transfer to Penn as an Economics and International relations major. Also, I have four letters of recommendations from my professors from the classes I've done well in.\nI do realize that grades aren't the whole factor when applying for transfer admission, or admission in general. One does need a certain something that would make them stick out and I believe I have that. Long story short, for the past 18 months or so, I've been writing for a basketball website based in Europe. My title, quote on quote, is a reporter. Since the 2017-2018 season, I've been covering games for the Philadelphia 76ers and since then, I've been able to conduct over a dozen pre and postgame interviews with NBA players. Along with those, I've been able to conduct an exclusive interview with two players from the Sixers last May. Hopefully, I'll do more in the future.\nWith all of that, I also have an interest in applying for the Communication major at Penn. With that experience I was able to gain through covering NBA games, could that make my application stick out, hence increasing my chances of being admitted? I'll make sure to mention it in my application, but I wanted to put it on this forum to see what prospective transfer students thought. Thank you, everyone! I hope to keep posting on this forum for these next few months.

Even more so for transfers where the acceptance rates are (usually) lower than freshman rate. From the information I have read in past threads here is what I have learned. Having a respectable GPA/EC (+ SAT can vary) is just going to be a given component. If you are lacking in those you are already at a disadvantage. Having a 4.0, 1600 SAT, great AP Scores, amazing EC's does not guarantee you admission to any of these schools. Once you get your foot in the door with these stats it's all about how you frame yourself fitting into the school/major of your choice.

I applied as a Fall 2019 transfer as well and could use some feedback on how strong of an applicant I am.\nSchool: Stony Brook University\nMajor: Political Science\nCredits: 59 completed\nCollege GPA: 3.71/4.0 (one C in a Calculus 2 class I did not even need for my major). Overall, very high upward trend: 3.31, 3.82, 4.0\nSAT: 1280 (probably the weakest part of my application)\nCollege extracurriculars: President of my fraternity's chapter at Stony Brook, service trip to Honduras in partnership with Students Helping Honduras, service trip to Pinellas County, Florida in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, Secretary of a club on campus that 3D-prints toys for children in the nearby hospital and daycare, Content creator (writer) for an online writing platform, TA for an Introduction to Stony Brook class, Undergraduate College \"Fellow\": essentially serves to be an on-campus mentor for first year students, member of the debate club, member of Model United Nations club, Member of Pre-Law Society here at the university. I also have an on-campus job at the Stony Brook business school.\nRecommendations: 8-9/10\nGot three professor recommendations. One of them was a writing professor that I had during my first semester in college. She was crying when I walked out on the last day of classes. One of them was my professor for an upper-division political science class (300+ level) I had. I was the youngest student in the class and still received an A. This individual also has a PhD in Political Science. Lastly, another adjunct political science professor at the university wrote about some of my experiences in Honduras as that is her field of study.\nI also got a recommendation from a former high-ranking government official who knows me and my personal life struggles fairly well.\nEssays: 7/10. I do believe I could've done better at the essays. I was very blunt about the reasons why I wanted to leave my current institution and mentioned some of the specific programs I'd like to take advantage of at Penn. I also talked about the College of Arts and Sciences curriculum (the three parts) and how that will allow me to explore my academic and intellectual interests.\nHigh school GPA: 93/100 (we did not have a GPA format). Also very high upward trend: started with getting mid 80s and ended up getting over 100s in my junior/senior years.\nAP courses taken: AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP Physics, AP Human Geography, AP US History\nHigh school extracurriculars: Over 50 volunteer service hours at my local community center, participated at the NY FED Challenge at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was treasure in Student government, attended various math competitions, took college-credit courses in high-school (2 classes), worked at a construction management firm under as a law apprentice/cost estimator.\nHooks: First generation college student with an absent father and a deceased mother\nAny feedback is appreciated!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm done with finals, so I've got nothing better to do :-)\nOne piece of advice I will give any prospective transfer (Penn or elsewhere) is to look at the transfer community at the schools you are considering. If you transfer, it is likely that many of your best friends, at least early, will be transfers. In general, it is more challenging to transition to a new school as a sophomore or junior than it is a freshman.

It was fully funded by Pakistani govt and US department of state.\nEssays: Wrote my essay on the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India: A risky and controversial move but I made it clear in the essay that no amount of controversy can preclude me from writing about what I am truly passionate about.\nTeacher Recommendations: A very generous professor at Georgetown offered to write a rec for me. Haven't read it but we had a good rapport and she (thankfully) regarded my passion with admiration.\nEconomics Sir wrote an exceptional rec for me. I had written a research paper with him on political economy and he mentioned my proposals to combat economic crises in Pakistan to in the letter.\nAccounting teacher wrote the last one. We were very close and she knew me well and believed that I would do well at UPenn.\nCounselor Rec: My Vice Principal was my counselor and wrote a flattering rec.\nCity/Country: Lahore, Pakistan.\nSchool Type: Private.

I think being multilingual helped a bit.\nWhy you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: Test scores were really poor but I justified it since I'm an international student and know nothing about US history. Couldn't take multiple attempts because SATs here are expensive.\nI think my essays were good although the Penn supplement was mediocre at best. My recs probably saved me and my American professor was too generous in her praise!\nFinally, I used to spend hours through these threads like you guys trust me we get through it. To all international students and esp Pakistani ones, you can do this. I did it on my own you don't have to pay heaps of money to get into an ivy league.\nAnd finally, to the US students: I see most of your parents are very much involved in the admissions process. Please cherish that and love them for it. Parents from Pakistan and I'm sure other Asian countries (mostly) are completely reliant on their kids, not well acquainted with international admissions systems and we do everything on our own (and failure isn't an option lol!).

Also I'm a junior that goes to the best school in Frankfort, KY (not hard to be best school in Frankfort, KY though lol). I want to major maybe in Entrepreneurship w a minor in social impact or something like that. Thanks so much to those who actually read this wall of text :P.\nObjective:\nSAT I: 1560\nACT: 35, 36 superscored\nSAT II: Math II, confident I can get at least 750, probably 800. Maybe Physics too, which I think I'll get 700+ on as well\nUnweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.9\nWeighted GPA: about 4.5\nRank (percentile if rank is unavailable): doesn't rank\nAP (place score in parenthesis): 2 freshman (4,5), 2 soph(4,5), 6 junior (all probably 4s/5s), 4 to 6 APs next year.\nI don't have any major awards, just basic stuff like AP Scholar (hopefully w/ distinction) and NMSF (got 1520 so def happening). I'm hoping to get featured in a local newspaper for something (don't want to reveal identity) and I'm attending a statewide economics competition (but it's KY, so not that competitive or impressive lol).\nExtracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):\n1. Founder and President of a nonprofit. Holding an event that donates books to underprivileged kids (oversimplification, a lot of community impact here, very proud of it).\n2. President of my school's economics club.\n3. Director of Finance/Expansion in another nonprofit.\nthat's all my leadership positions... rip.\n4. Black Student Union\n5. Ultimate Frisbee + Gym\n6. Confident I'll be able to attend KY GSP (summer program)\n7. Familial Responsibilities (a lot fresh and soph year because of financial issues, junior year onwards not as much - just babysitting after school for 2-3 hours)\n8. Personal Research. I manage my own stock portfolio. It's very small (<$1000), but I spend a lot of time working on it and I've learned a lot from it. shoutout to r/wsb for letting me know what NOT to do.\n9. NHS. Led a couple community service projects, but not sure if I'll include this since it's kind of inconsistent (i.e. no consistent involvement).\nJob/Work Experience: Nothing formal, neighborhood tutoring school year and lawn mowing over summer - I clean an office once a week year-round though. Like 90% of the money I make from all of this goes to my family though which is something worth mentioning if possible.\nVolunteer/Community service: A lot, mostly meaningful (nonprofits from first and third ECs tie in w my background and stuff).\nSummer Activities: Fresh and soph summers I just mowed lawns and babysitted my two little siblings. Junior hopefully GSP (EC #6).\nEssays (rating 1-10, details): not sure what to write about - maybe rising out of poverty and/or babysitting siblings (both pretty young, big age gap) and/or not knowing my biological father personally. I'll prob be able to tie all this in together, and all of this really built who I am as a person - very authentic.\nRecommendations (rating 1-10, details): Econ teacher literally offered to write me a rec, so I'm sure it'll be great. Latin teacher likes me a lot, and I'm hoping to take AP Latin (if I can, I'll be the only AP Latin student, demonstrating initiative and forming a relationship w my Latin teacher).\nCounselor Rec (rating 1-10, details): Been talking to her a lot recently, and she helped me plan events for my nonprofit. Knows my community-mindedness and general concern for others' wellbeing very well.\nFinancial Aid: Yes, family income of around 80-90k. Not sure if this matters but it used to be significantly lower (I was homeless for a year in 7th-8th grade because money was so tight). On food stamps till i was like 11.\nEthnicity: African-American\nGender: M\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): URM\nAgain, thanks SO SO much to those who read all this!! I know it's a lot to take in haha. If anything kills me, it's my lack of legit awards and leadership like these other kids who are the President of every club at their school lmao.

The fact you are getting press recognition is another plus.\nI like your essay ideas- the resilience you show overcoming hardships in your background to achieve the success you have achieved will resonate!

Also, my school has been known to send wrong letters of recommendation, so they might have received letters from teachers who weren\u2019t core academic teachers junior/senior year.

While the idea was personal, I think the writing could\u2019ve been more sophisticated\nTeacher Recommendations: 9.5/10-Journalism/AP Lang Teacher: I had her bath my sophomore and junior year and we always had a very strong relationship. She pushed me to join the school newspaper and encouraged the growth of my writing, and we always had intellectual conversations about our views. We were very close and she actually reached out to me about writing my recommendation. She was definitely able to portray a better reflection of my personality/individuality\n8/10-Medical Terminology/Anatomy and Physiology: I think he gave a good insight into why I want to go into the medical field and how I worked towards my goals, but we didn\u2019t have as much of a personal relationship.

I also introduced JCCC as a volunteering opportunity as well.\nSummer Experience: These took up 3 sections on my common app activities.\n1. I traveled to Taiwan summer of 2018 to teach English at local elementary schools for the AID program. Wrote and gave closing ceremony speech in Mandarin. Team captain for the volunteers assigned to our specific school\n2. I attended 3 Chinese cultural camps in the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017 in 3 different Chinese cities, sponsored by the Chinese gov targeting foreign born Chinese children.\n3. I attended a buddhism and ancient chinese education camp in summer of 2015 (9th grade), spoke alongside head monk to about 2000 native Chinese about the significance of the camp for an American.\nTeacher Recommendation #1: Spanish 3 Junior Year Teacher - He let me read it and it captured my interests in business and international studies. Also really emphasized how ambitious I am and my intelligence and kindness in his class. Also talked about an instance where I demonstrated empathy, and my love for foreign cultures and languages.\nTeacher Recommendation #2: AP Calc BC, Calc 3, and Differential Equation junior and senior year teacher - She loved me and although I have no idea what she wrote, I did submit info about myself, my dreams etc for her to write my letter. I am very outgoing and outspoken in her class, and achieve a great balance between fun and work ethic and she probably wrote about that. She also sponsors math club and I have gone with her to a few math competitions revealing the competitive yet good sport side in me too. Overall took almost two months for her to write (everyone asks her because she is the best teacher we have ever been taught by, hands down)\nCounselor Rec: 9/10, he wrote a penn specific rec just for me because he knew how much I wanted to get in! He knows my family pretty well because he also had my brother who is now a junior in college.\nAdditional Info/Rec: 9 or 10/10, Got a rec from the vice principal of the Taiwan elementary school I volunteered at. She actually wrote a Huntsman specific rec and did a lot of research on the program! She really loved me during the month in Taiwan and we still keep in touch.\nInterview: 7.5/10, Average, I got most of my points across.

Gave examples of international events regarding Chinese tourists which reflected my knowledge on global affairs, and also talked about how though I am unable to solve it now, Huntsman will provide the tools and experiences for me to do so. I think the topic was pretty unique, because imo a lot of Chinese applicants would write about the south China sea conflict, the belt and road initiative, or the trade war\nCommonApp Essay: 9.5/10, talked about my encounter with a lady on a Nanchang, China public city bus.

I was never expecting M&T, despite my obsessing over it for two years now. It feels good, I guess, to be considered still. (I couldn't have been accepted to SEAS alone as I applied to it RD.) Regardless, the future holds many opportunities, and my biggest takeaway is to seize them by their horns. I can't wait to apply that in my journey, as this one (high school) comes to an end.

All of my writing is 100% me- honest and personality.\nWhy Penn: Honestly I think it was pretty good, probably not perfect though. I focused on Huntsman and Wharton and how the mix of influences fits me.\nAny dual-degree program essays: About women in business and global equality. Also not perfect, but probably not bad.\nCommonApp Essay: By far my favorite. Centered on one of my favorite events studying abroad and what my friends there helped me learn about the world and about life.

I decided a few years ago I wanted more that I was getting, and I went for it- I took extra college classes and AP tests, created opportunities where there were none, and applied for programs I really love. I don't kill myself over just school and I really care, and I think that comes out well in my application. I got to be a part of a lot of amazing programs that probably looked pretty good as well.\nWeaknesses: Not that many advanced classes before this year, erratic EC's because of school switching, not an eye-catching SAT/ACT...\nWere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted UGA, Berry, and U. South Carolina so far...\nWhat would you have done differently?: Besides go to a different school at the beginning of hs (my old school held me back in a lot of ways), and maybe studying for SAT/Subjects more...oh and getting my essays more smoothed out!- well I really wouldn't change anything. I feel like I got everything I wanted out of high school, had fun, learned and grew a lot, and didn't spend all my time obsessing about how to get into college (probably why I was so unprepared but oh well). Upenn is a long shot, and right now I wouldn't go back and change what got me this far\nOther Factors: ", "user_id": "100706013", "user_name": "EmLe0599 ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "10"}, {"date": {"month": "December", "day": "13,", "year": "2018", "time": "9:55PM"}, "comment": "\n[ color=orange]Decision: Rejected - M&T[ /color]\nObjective:\nSAT I (breakdown M/CR/W/Essay): 800/730/18\nSAT I superscore (breakdown M/CR/W/Essay): 1530\nACT (breakdown):\nACT superscore (breakdown):\nSAT II (subject, score): 790 French 740 Math 2 710 Chem\nUnweighted/Weighted GPA: 4.0\nRank (percentile if rank is unavailable): top 10%\nAP/IB (place score in parentheses):\nSenior Year Course Load:\nNumber of other ED applicants in your school:\nMajor Awards (USAMO, Intel, etc.):\nCommon Awards (AP Scholar, honor roll, NM things, etc.): Dean's list\nSubjective:\nExtracurriculars (name, grade levels, leadership, description): Run Video Production Company as COO\nGuitarist\nPresident DECA & Band club, Guitarist\nStarted Ecommerce store\nJob/Work Experience: Tech startup internship in operations\nVolunteer/Community Service: tutoring\nSummer Experience:\nTeacher Recommendation #1: 10/10 french teach 1000 word rec\nTeacher Recommendation #2: 5/10 cal teacher who did not know me well\nCounselor Rec: 7/10 met a few times\nAdditional Info/Rec: 10/10 written by boss who i was super close with\nInterview: 30 minute skype interview guy asked 2 questions (who are you? what do you do for fun?)\nWriting (Subject, 1-10 rating, details):\nWhy Penn: 8 described research and interdisciplinary\nAny dual-degree program essays: 8/10 talked about crypto\nCommonApp Essay: 9/10 showed my love for tech and entrepreneurship\nOther:\nDate Submitted App: oct 31\nApplied for Financial Aid? yes\nU.S. State/Territory or Country: canada\nSchool Type: canadian CEGEP\nEthnicity: Bengali\nGender:M\nIncome Bracket Range: 150k\nHooks (URM, first generation, recruited athelete, development):\nReflection\nStrengths:\nWeaknesses: sat 2 scores and reference letter\nWere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected:\nWhat would you have done differently?: build more rapport with counselor and teachers. spend more time on essay\nOther Factors: ", "user_id": "100635646", "user_name": "Jonayed ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "1"}, {"date": {"month": "December", "day": "13,", "year": "2018", "time": "10:02PM"}, "comment": "\n[ color=green]Decision: Accepted - CAS[ /color]\nObjective:\nSAT I (breakdown M/CR/W/Essay): N/A\nSAT I superscore (breakdown M/CR/W/Essay): N/A\nACT (breakdown): 33 (R: 36, M: 31, E: 32, S: 31)\nACT superscore (breakdown): 34 (R:36, M:32, E:35, S:32)\nSAT II (subject, score): did not take-ik oof\nUnweighted/Weighted GPA: school does not have gpa but I when I applied for some scholarships I had to calculate it and it was a 3.92/4.0\nRank (percentile if rank is unavailable): School does not rank\nAP/IB (place score in parentheses): School has no AP, IB or Honors course (Crazy right!!)\nSenior Year Course Load:\nLiterature Seminar: Exile and Immigration\nCalculus II\n20th Century Morality\nForensics\nSpanish Literature\nStudio Art\nNumber of other ED applicants in your school: 3 including me (other two were both legacies) but my school is small only 60 kids in my grade\nMajor Awards (USAMO, Intel, etc.):\nNSLI-Y Scholarship: state department merit-based scholarship to study abroad in China for 6 weeks\nLeadership Experiment Institute Scholarship: merit-based scholarship to study abroad in India for 4 weeks\nYale Young Global Scholars: Politics and Economics (idk if this counts lol....)\nAmerican Heart Association Lifesaver Award\nCommon Awards (AP Scholar, honor roll, NM things, etc.):\nSubjective:\nExtracurriculars (name, grade levels, leadership, description):\nFounder of School's Jewish Affinity Group (11, 12)\nEditor of School Newspaper (9,10,11,12)\nInvited Participant of School's student hiring committee (11+12)\nJob/Work Experience:\nIntern for New York Supreme Court Justice (11+12)\nSocial Media Director and Administrative Assistant at an Immigration Lawfirm (11+12)\nSummer Intern at a Criminal Justice Lawfirm\nBirthday Party Supervisor at an Arts and Crafts Studio (since 6th grade-11)\nVolunteer/Community Service:\nAmerican Heart Association (AHA) Red Cap Child Ambassador (since 5th grade-present): speak at various AHA events and tell survivor story.

She let me read it, I think she spoke very highly of me and showed my academic curiosity and how I extended it outside of the classroom by volunteering at the historical museum.\nTeacher Recommendation #2: 8/10?? My AP Bio teacher. She loved me and thought I was extremely creative as I would make claymation biology videos for her class. She saw my love for biology as I took it outside of the classroom as well. However, we were not extremely close when she wrote the letter.\nCounselor Rec: 7/10.

I think this is definitely the reason I got deferred instead of rejected.\nReflection\nStrengths: Honestly don't think I have many strengths. My interview was good. I think my niche of biology and political science sets me apart from other applicants.\nWeaknesses: TEST SCORES. ECs didn't get good until my senior year, which is what Penn didn't see (but in the context of my high school they are amazing). Why Penn could have been more creative but still was pretty specific.\nWere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted Pitt but haven't heard back from anyone else yet\nWhat would you have done differently?: So much. Would have started studying for ACT earlier. Would have tried to figure out what I wanted to major in my freshman year so I could have gotten more focused ECs (I sort of just did what I wanted). Test scores most important though. I wish I started studying earlier and could have submitted a better ACT.\nOther Factors: My dad working at Penn no doubt played a part in me being deferred instead of rejected. Definitely a hook.\nReflection: I am very grateful for a deferral. I have the chance to send in my most recent SAT subject test scores in bio M and literature, and to send my December ACT which may have hit the 33 mark. I have a chance to send a LOCI about the research and volunteering I'm doing. The acceptance rate for deferred applicants is around 16% in the RD round, and that number doesn't scare me too much at all considering it's about the ED acceptance rate. I am very fine with my deferral and am glad that Penn is giving me another chance to show who I am.

PLEASE apply if you are a junior this year. You get to meet Penn admissions and your regional rep (aka the person who reads your app for the first time) which helps immensely. If you are accepted to PEEP it means that admissions likes you which helps you when you apply to the school for real. The fly-in also helps you see if you really like Penn and if you would want to apply ED. Getting into PEEP is not a guarantee of admission but it definitely helps. In the same way, not getting into PEEP does not mean you won't get into the school. Also, if you love Penn, consider applying ED!!

It was fully funded by Pakistani govt and US department of state.\nEssays: Wrote my essay on the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India: A risky and controversial move but I made it clear in the essay that no amount of controversy can preclude me from writing about what I am truly passionate about.\nTeacher Recommendations: A very generous professor at Georgetown offered to write a rec for me. Haven't read it but we had a good rapport and she (thankfully) regarded my passion with admiration.\nEconomics Sir wrote an exceptional rec for me. I had written a research paper with him on political economy and he mentioned my proposals to combat economic crises in Pakistan to in the letter.\nAccounting teacher wrote the last one. We were very close and she knew me well and believed that I would do well at UPenn.\nCounselor Rec: My Vice Principal was my counselor and wrote a flattering rec.\nCity/Country: Lahore, Pakistan.\nSchool Type: Private. International but not renowned.\nEthnicity: Asian (South Asian).\nGender: Female\nIncome Bracket: Not sure about the parameters in US.\nReceived a full ride though. (100% aid since Pakistani rupee is badly depreciated and even the well-to-do here would be considered financially weak in US).\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I speak four languages with fluency (Urdu-mother tongue- English, Turkish and Punjabi-regional), I can read and understand a bit of Arabic and Japanese and I am learning Spanish. I think being multilingual helped a bit.\nWhy you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: Test scores were really poor but I justified it since I'm an international student and know nothing about US history. Couldn't take multiple attempts because SATs here are expensive.\nI think my essays were good although the Penn supplement was mediocre at best. My recs probably saved me and my American professor was too generous in her praise!\nFinally, I used to spend hours through these threads like you guys trust me we get through it. To all international students and esp Pakistani ones, you can do this. I did it on my own you don't have to pay heaps of money to get into an ivy league.\nAnd finally, to the US students: I see most of your parents are very much involved in the admissions process. Please cherish that and love them for it. Parents from Pakistan and I'm sure other Asian countries (mostly) are completely reliant on their kids, not well acquainted with international admissions systems and we do everything on our own (and failure isn't an option lol!).

Just got asked this question and IDK how to answer with current knowledge -- how hard or easy is it really to internally transfer from College to Wharton nowadays? I know the pendulum has swung back and forth on this.\nWhen I was there, they made the GPA requirements harder -- you had to have a 3.7 to even be considered and then they basically ordered the potential transferee list top to bottom based on GPA and the top x number of people got in (in my class year it was ~10) and the people who got in were really in the 3.9+ range.\nA few years later, it seemed like it had gotten MUCH easier because there was a class year where like 60 people applied and almost all got in. And then it seemed like the school took notice of that back door and started saying you could get transfer consideration at around a 3.4+ GPA but there's an essay where you have to explain what has changed since last year that now you want to be in the business school; so I imagine that's cut the transfers back from ~60 to some more \"reasonable\" number and maybe also opened it up a bit where it's a less formulaic process. Like if it's glaringly obvious to them from last year's CAS essay + the transfer essay that you intended to transfer in all along, they can say no even if you have a 3.8.\nSo how is it right now?

As someone who applied to Wharton last year, I would advise you to focus all of your college essays on how you are developing your passion for economics because Wharton's finance program is extremely competitive. If Wharton is your top choice, I would highly recommend applying ED, as its ED program has about a 25% acceptance rate. The acceptance rate for regular decision is closer to 8%. Spend your first semester senior year being involved in economics as much as possible and focus your essays on your exploration of economics for the greatest chance of being accepted. Applying early or regular decision has no impact on finanial aid distributed. Furthermore, if you are accepted early and demonstrate that they did not provide the financial aid you need, you can be exempt from being required to attend the college.

Would you guys say that, in the beginning when everyone's getting to know each other, that it's just as easy to be social/make friends/ go to parties in a single as it is in a double?
