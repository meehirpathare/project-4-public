How much will having a slightly lower GPA and class rank than the average (since most kids are top 1-2%) hurt me?

That is most definitely NOT the case at Penn and most ALL of the clubs have extensive application processes that includes resumes and multiple rounds of interviews, including and especially, the service related clubs!!\nThis doesn't mean you cant go to the events the clubs offer or participate in community service through the events, in fact, the more you do that (and chat up members in the club at the events) the more likely you are to eventually get in the club. So sign up for the list serv of the club's you are interested in and participate as much as you can. If there is a club you really want, keep trying for spring semester or sophomore or even junior year... and network/ ask around for advice ...upperclassmen will help you!

Lots of good stuff-\nBut... this is the one aspect about Penn my son said he wished he would have known about sooner bc in hindsight he should have studied over the summer all of the different club offerings, picked out the ones that interested him, gotten the low down on them from group chats etc and prepared a game plan so it wasn't so overwhelming/stressful.\nPenn does a 2 hour club fair at the beginning of semester, but he said it was hard to see all of the clubs and talk to them/ sign up for list serv in that time frame, bc there are so many and the process with its competitiveness can become ... so I would recommend really studying Penn's website with regards to all the clubs and come up with targets and a game plan.

I've been going through this all my life. My grandmother got cancer a year before I was born. I grew up going to the hospital to visit my grandmother. Watching her go through all sorts of surgeries and chemotherapy was terrible. I even had to move to India to take care of her. 3 years ago, when my grandmother passed away, she died right in front of my eyes. She was laying on the bed of my guest room, and she died. And now 3 years later, I live in the USA, my mom has cancer and I have to go through everything again. This school year has been a terrible year and I haven't been able to focus on school since then.

You want to enjoy your experience and have a traditional college experience. If you think you will be happier in the Penn environment, it is worth considering. Those experiences also create the bonds that lead to a strong Alumni network.\nPenn has better weather. As the southernmost Ivy, it gets a lot less snow and cold than Harvard. Another quality of life improvement.\nAny difference in academic rigor should be slight, if it is noticeable at all. Incoming Penn students have a bit lower test scores than Harvard students, but had higher high school GPA's. Not much of a difference. Penn's experience is that GPA is more predictive of success than test scores are.\nWith regard to careers, Harvard can't be beat for opening doors. However, after Harvard, Penn grads have the second highest average salaries in the Ivy League, so it isn't a huge step down, and for many it isn't a step down at all.\nAn irony of this process is that many students want top colleges because of the brand. However, the students who actually get in and are successful don't really need the brand. I suspect you will, be a big success, wherever you choose to enroll.\nOverall, Harvard is a slightly better opportunity, but if you think you will fit better in the Penn environment, then you may be more successful where you feel you belong and fit in better.

I would start by saying that your Harvard education at the undergraduate level will not be superior to your Penn undergraduate education. I work with lots of Ivy alums and frankly, everyone from Columbia and Yale are just as smart as the kids from Penn, Princeton and Harvard-- they attract strikingly similar student bodies on the whole and provide very similar opportunities to their students. Harvard students do tend to have marginally higher SAT scores but Penn students have marginally higher high school GPAs. Both schools will be full of diverse and passionate students who are excited to take on the most exciting educational endeavors of their lives. At this level of university, I think it's most important to consider fit. Harvard and Penn students take nearly identical jobs after graduation and attend nearly identical graduate schools (the variations between them are probably due in large part to self selection). Harvard has a much more experienced staff for students trying to attain Rhodes Scholarships but the difference between them is negligible and Rhodes Scholarships are so rare that you shouldn't really consider it as a major factor when choosing a school. And Penn does have its share of Rhodes scholars and since they've instituted policies similar to those of Harvard's they've been sending more students to Oxford with much greater frequency.

Classics program is pretty good, based on friends has more focus on languages (ex. grammar) than the other bits. Academics here are actually intensely rigorous and more difficult than other ivies or equivalents. For instance, economics here is highly technical and about as difficult as the MIT version (compare game theory) and leagues above the Yale version. In that sense, this place sucks. Also there is no grade inflation. In fact, there is minor grade deflation for some awful reason. As a Classics major you'll probably be fine though.\nAs for quality of intelligence, I have not met anyone from other ivies or MIT/Stanford who are categorically superior. To be honest (small sample size), it's been the opposite. This has been one of the most well-read environments I've ever been in and conversations can often switch from machine learning to Benjamin, critical theory, phenomenology, politic, etc. For some **** reason everyone here knows another language and can play a musical instrument.\nPenn is hyper-competitive and stressful af. There's a big hookup culture. It's not great for relationships. People can be **** and very unfriendly. Most everyone is in a state of existential despair over OCR, being coerced into finance/consulting/tech, and their gradually sinking GPA. NOTE: 50% of our undergrads go into finance/consulting which is twice that of other ivies (except Columbia). ANOTHER NOTE: You are a Classics guy and that is going to **** suck. Idk about Harvard, but clubs here are also incredibly difficult to get into. You need a resume (lol). There are constant parties. Everyone's always drinking or smoking up. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Sunday is more of a rest period, as is Monday and Tuesday but if you've got a group of friends you will most likely be able to hang out and drink whenever you want. It's expensive.\nIt's true that people here are smart, party a lot, etc. But it is difficult to be happy at Penn. Let me reiterate. It is difficult to be happy here. I'm sure other ivies suffer from this as well,and maybe it's just looking for greener pastures but Harvard's grade inflation is bound to help.

You say \"it's difficult to be happy [at UPenn]\" and that's an important realization for you. I encourage you to accept this and to work hard to find the niches/pockets that make you happy. Penn is a huge school and, as a result, has many silos and niches. Find yours.@Penn95 says...\n\"MOST people\" do not drink and party all the time;\" \"MANY people really fit in at Penn,\" re finance and consulting (bc of Wharton) \"MORE people are bound to take these jobs...\"\nLet's take what's implied in your post... it leaves considerable room for SOME people who may feel quite different. You say many and most feel a certain way, so surely some must not, right?\nCollege is all about proportions, and the question is, how many are in that group of \"SOME people\"?\nI have a hunch that you and @humanbean12 have a VERY different perception of how many people are in that \"some\" group.\nI'm pretty sure Adam Grant, the members of Penn's mental health task force, Hikaru Kozuma (Penn's excellent vice provost for undergrad life), CAPS counselors, and many others may have a different view than you, too.\nAgain, not saying Penn's problems are worse than other schools, because that ruffles too many feathers here.

Yes some people of course do not fit in. That is true for any school.

There are many things you don't like about Penn. But that doesn't mean these things are seen as negatives at Penn by most others or that they should change. Many of the things you do not like about Penn actually give Penn its unique identity and are a major attraction for applicants.\nYou can't know what the Provost or CAPS counselors think. As for the Adam Grant article there are many issues with it as we have discussed before: saying Penn has a the most competitive culture he has personally ever seen doesnt make Penn an outlier in terms of competitiveness. He went to college a long time ago and the schools he went to , taught at are not traditionally considered intense/ competitive. But we have already gone through all that.\nBtw you shouldn't be saying that Penn's problems are bigger than other schools because it is simply not true, not because it ruffles feathers. And it ruffles feathers simply because it is not based on the truth.\nOf course no one is saying Penn is perfect and that there isn't work to be done.

As a start, you can check this on mental health across the ivies: http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2015/10/mental-health-around-the-ivies\nAlso, did Penn finally release the results of the mental health task force survey? They released conclusions publicly, but, any current (or prospective) Penn student should ask for survey results. Thats a helpful document. The Brown Daily Herald reported their school's results, Many other schools did too.\nInterested parties can also ask admins for health counselors per capita, look into avg. wait times for mental health centers, types of centralization on campus (are all groups housed under one roof - or are there many and different offices overseeing groups?), (looking at Clery Act crime reports between colleges isn't a bad idea either).\nThis forum - and the biggest posters here - make this space a suboptimal place for a comparative discussion, but for interested parties, do some digging. Pull the survey results, see the data released by schools, do some analysis, etc.\nRe the \"of course not ALL people fit in at Penn,\" the key is to determine what the proportions are. You say \"most people do not drink and party all the time,\" and, re finance/consulting \"more people\" look into this area, but interested parties can delve into what the estimated numbers are, and see if they are comfortable with these numbers. What is \"most people\"? How do we define \"many people\"? Every person has a different tolerance for this. While the proportions made UPenn seem ideal to you, the proportions are clearly off for @humanbean12\nAs I said above, college - especially top colleges - is all about proportions. If say, 50% of employed grads at UPenn went into finance/consulting*, vs. 20% at another top college**, what speaks more to the consumer of this info? It's an individualized choice, of course, but there's lots of data out there. If say, mental health survey results find that 33% of Penn students binge drink on a weekly basis, that's a minority, but it may be too much for some.\nYour posts, however, don't present numbers/evidence. Rather, they tend to present broad, bland, pleasant-sounding generalizations about the school (most people aren't competitive, most people fit in, there are \"lots\" of spaces for everyone). How the heck can we know that \"most people at Penn aren't competitive\"? Based on my anecdotal experience, I actually agree with you - I didn't find students competing with one another often, but I also know this was just my skewed view. In this way, your posts remind me of admissions work - it presents a pleasant view that can cater to a broad swath of people.\nI doubt Admissions brings up the mental health task force report and reasons behind it, the internal push for a larger sexual violence prevention office, the sudden, reactionary infusion of resources/hires at CAPS, etc. When other posters raise these issues, you address them concomitantly, but fall back to the mantra of \"all schools have problems and should improve.\" Again, it reminds me too much of admissions-speak, and maybe this agitates me because I view admissions officers so skeptically.\nTo sum, I think Penn is a good school, and I am lucky to hold a degree from there. It is also a deeply complicated place, and you too often just skim the surface of this complexity. (And yes, I understand that \"all schools are complicated places.\" I'm only situated to comment on a few, though.)\n* Penn keeps excellent career reports, and they can be found here: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/reports.php - for the past few years, across all Penn schools (Wharton, liberal arts, nursing, engineering) fin/consulting jobs make up about 45% of the jobs grads take immediately after graduation.\n** Lots of other schools offer good career reports. Again, I don't want to get into comparison's here, but just google \"x school's career outcome report,\" and there's usually data out there. Cultural Climate survey reports are also an excellent place to check. Just google \"x school's climate report or x school's student culture report.\" Many schools now release data on binge drinking, inclusion issues, etc. ", "user_id": "100374735", "user_name": "Cue7 ", "user_thread_count": "119", "user_comment_count": "2724"}, {"date": {"month": "May", "day": "1,", "year": "2017", "time": "10:42PM"}, "comment": "\n@Cue7 lets start from the career survey report . In CAS, 30% of the 66% that get jobs right after college, go into finance/consulting. This is 20% of the CAS responders. Now keep in mind that within this CAS population there are many dual degree kids (CAS wharton) who of course gravitate towards those industries. So after you take the dual degree kids out the % of the CAS population going to finance/consulting is probably around 10-15%. nowhere near 45% in any case.\nFor SEAS, 35% of the 76% of students who are getting jobs straight after graduation go to finance consulting. This is about 27% of the total people in the survey. Again there is a big number of wharton dual degree students in SEAS ( 55 students replied on the survey to be exact). This is 15% of the total survey responses.\nSo the percentage of non-wharton kids on the survey that go into finance/consulting is 12% of the total reconsider.\nBy comparison the Wharton survey shows that about 43% of responders are going to consulting/finance.\nSo yes i am right when I am saying that it is Wharton that skews the numbers upwards.

People from around the world flock to wharton undergrad because they are interested in business.

Wharton isn't in a silo - all schools are part of the \"one university\" policy. All these students are living together, eating together, joining the same clubs, etc.\nI will NOT compare Penn to another college, but is this much different than a situation where most of the fin/consulting types major in econ? One could argue \"yes, 42% of our college job seekers go into fin/con, but the vast majority of that group are econ majors\". Who cares? Again, they are all part of the same undergrad - mingling together, living together, etc. The data still shows that one industry has a fairly disproportionate impact and weight on campus - even if most going into that industry come primarily from one major (or one school).\nIn my hypothetical, it's perfectly reasonable to think that those NOT majoring in econ (in english, art history, whatever) have more diverse interests. The point is, disregarding the major/school, if 40%+ of your job seekers are going into one sector, that's a pretty big gorilla in the room.\n(Especially when you consider that there is no accreditation for banking/consulting - Penn has a great nursing school, but only those going to nursing school can be registered nurses.)\nPut another way, whether it's Wharton, econ majors, stats majors, whatever, the overall proportions matter, and the 42% number is telling. Interestingly, some other top schools also send 40%+ of their grads to these industries, and there are other top schools that don't. That's not a good or bad thing, just something that consumers should take into account. And, there's ample data out there to assess.\nAlso @Penn95 - @Much2learn said: \"... as far as crime goes, the Penn campus is the worst place to commit a crime. There are police and cameras everywhere. Anyone committing a crime on Penn's campus is going to be caught. Criminals know that.\"\nHow do we know that \"anyone committing a crime on Penn's campus is going to be caught\"? How the heck can you say that? Further, why would criminals know that? Also, does s/he mean the worst place \"in University City,\" or a broader area? S/he doesn't specify, and I think you'll agree, the statement is both remarkably ambiguous*, and vaguely positive about Penn without presenting any evidence.\nFurther, I contest your point that the campus \"is the worst place in the area to commit a crime\" because college students, typically, open themselves up to crime more than most. If you look at crime data, there are actually some neighborhoods just west of Penn that are actually SAFER than the campus itself. I'm guessing, in those residential neighborhoods composed of young families, you have fewer instances of people walking around drunk at 3am (easy targets), and less opportunity for the biggest criminals on campus - students themselves - to commit crimes.\n(Remember, on almost any college campus, the most frequent crime that takes place is student on student.)\n*To combat the needless ambiguity, just look at UPenn's safety reports for the past 7 years, found here: https://www.publicsafety.upenn.edu/clery/annual-security-fire-safety-report/ There's detailed data there. All schools are required, by federal law, to produce such reports. So see how the rates of burglaries/robberies/violent crime compare on a per capita basis to other schools. All the data is there!

Wharton of course is not a silo but it is extremely self selected, it attracts students very interested in these specific industries. So yes it matters that most of the kids going into finance/consulting come from Wharton. if it was the case that 42% of CAS and SEAS students also went into finance consulting, then there would be a case that Penn students have rather limited professional interests. I do agree that this influences the undergrad culture overall, but obviously it doesnt dominate give that non-business majors go into finance/consulting in similar proportions to other top schools.\nComparing Wharton to the Econ majors at another comparable university is not accurate. Wharton is way more self-selected in terms of interests. It is not the same.\nRegarding security, we can say that because whenever there is a rarely a crime in the middle of campus, usually a little bit outside, and when it happens penn police sends out notifications within minutes and addresses the situation. in terms of security Penn has been doing a great job i feel.

That \"anyone committing a crime on Penn's campus is going to be caught\"? Apparently we're both not comfortable saying that, because you qualified this statement to read \"they most likely will be caught.\" (By the way, we don't know that either, do we? There is no data on attempted crimes, success rate at catching attempted criminals, etc. You're making a statement for which there is no basis.)\nAlso, are you arguing that, instead of Penn undergrad at-large having \"rather limited professional interests,\" it's actually Wharton undergrad that has limited professional interests? Business is a very large industry, but a huge chunk of Wharton undergrad goes into two very specific sectors. So, would you say that Wharton undergrad has a more limited professional focus, whereas the broader college does not?\nAlso, if a disproportionate number of Wharton students go into fin/con, how can you tell that it \"doesn't dominate undergrad culture\" because Penn non-business majors go into fin/con in similar proportions to other top schools? We don't have any data/evidence on how a certain field/culture/school can \"dominate\".\nThere are no publicly available reports on the success rate for non-Wharton penn students seeking jobs in these industries. It could be that a very high number of non-wharton majors seek fin/con jobs, but don't get them. OR, it could be just what you say, but we DON'T KNOW.\nMy hunch is that Wharton, traditionally, has held outsized influence at the University. I can't verfiy this, though, so I'm not going to take this assertion any further.\nFinally, this is incontrovertible: if nearly half of the job seekers enter a specific field, disregarding if they come from one school or not, you better believe that knowledge/conversations/notice about this field is in the air. These students all eat together, live together, etc., and this becomes a big part of the culture, whether or not other students actually go in that direction.\nAn example, if you permit me a moment to compare Penn to a school that is NOT a direct peer: Carnegie Mellon has a vast array of wonderful departments (a top-class drama school, actually), but the dominant vibe on campus, from what I know, is interest in the tech space. Most students don't actually enter this industry, but the culture is impacted by the influence of its world-class comp sci program. Just because the bulk of students don't go in this direction does NOT mean a certain industry doesn't have a disproportionate share of the limelight with a school's culture.\nAnd one more example, from Stanford: recently, their Dean of Admissions has expressed concern about the school turning into \"the Stanford Institute of Technology.\" https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq (p. 23). Stanford has phenomenal strength on the humanities, but the outsized influence there seems to be tech/comp sci. Interestingly, the majority of students do NOT go directly into this area, but it's pinpointed as an industry with outsized influence.\nI'm not sure why the overall college data wouldn't point to fin/consulting being outsized in influence at Penn.

I asked him a lot of questions when D was deciding to attend. He is very aware of what crime is occurring regularly. He says that the most common crimes involve kids who live in the area, often under 18, stealing an unlocked bike, or trying to grab a phone out of a students hand and run with it, or grabbing a computer that is left on a table alone by a student. These are petty crimes and the perps are caught with a high degree of frequency because there are so many police and cameras around the campus.\nI also spoke with one Penn student who said two area kids grabbed her phone and ran while she was texting and walking on campus. She said she immediately caught a cab to the Apple Store to get a replacement, and then called the campus police to report the crime. She said that by the time she called the Campus Police from the Apple Store maybe 30 minutes later, to report the crime, campus police already had the thief in custody, and her phone, and were in the process of trying to contact her. That is what I mean by it is a really bad place to commit a crime.\nI know you think that it isn't useful information if it did not come from a book, but I agree with the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \"You can observe a lot, just by watching.\" (And I would add, \"And asking questions.\")  ", "user_id": "100374735", "user_name": "Much2learn ", "user_thread_count": "168", "user_comment_count": "4610"}, {"date": {"month": "May", "day": "2,", "year": "2017", "time": "3:42PM"}, "comment": "\n@cue7\nOkay, so you really want to argue that when I said anyone who commits a crime on campus is going to be caught, that is not true.

Note, I CANNOT decide what you say, but it's helpful to provide such substantiation in your posts.\nThis being noted, your statement of: \"Anyone committing a crime on Penn's campus is going to be caught. Criminals know that,\" is still meritless. To prove this, we'd need to demonstrate that 100% of attempted and actual crimes committed resulted in the criminals getting caught. Further, if criminals did indeed \"know that,\" you'd see crime trend toward 0. The data doesn't show that.\nI should add, your post #35 did a lot more to add value - because you provide observations, not just assertions.

I have no idea what criminals know or don't know, and I suspect your insider's knowledge of the criminal element in West Philly is limited. Please, though, by all means, prove me wrong and substantiate that statement.\n(I should also add, crimes are notoriously under-reported on college campuses. I imagine that illegal drug sales happen at Penn, for example, and are either under-reported or just not reported. Such a trend would fly in the face of @Much2learn assertion that those who engage in criminal activity at Penn \"will most likely be caught.\" Penn, like any other college campus, has a tremendous amount of criminal activity that goes unreported, and I suspect that illegal drug sales are the highest chunk of this activity. If you just read @Much2learn cheery statements on campus crime, however, one wouldn't see that side of the coin.

There are still areas beyond a few blocks from campus where students do not feel so safe at night, but they either don't go there in the middle of the night or they ask to be escorted. Also the areas of Philly that are less safe are not in the direction that students usually want to go.

Also keep in mind that finance/consulting are career starters. as you say business is a very large industry. most people start out at finance/consulting for the first 2-4 years and then branch out to the area of business they are interested in.\nThe possibility of a large number of non-wharton kids trying but not getting finance/consulting jobs is highly far-fetched. First of all Penn students do not have any trouble getting these jobs, and also there are various different jobs in finance and consulting ranging widely in selectivity. if a person interested in consulting/finance is not able to get the tippy top jobs, they will most likely go for the slightly less selective ones, they will not just completely change industries.\nregarding wharton increasing the allure of finance/consulting in the rest of the penn population, the data shows that thidoes not seem to be significant. non-wharton Penn grads seem to go into finance/consulting in the comparable numbers as other ivies.

Useless Comparisons:\nYou've encouraged me not to compare Penn to other schools, and, in this case, I encourage you to do the same.\nHow many other top 10-12 colleges have an elite undergrad business school attached? None. Can you study the impact of having an elite undergrad b-school at any other top college? No.\nIn this case, it's actually best NOT to compare, and instead look at the impact of a top ugrad b-school at the ONE school where this exists: Penn.\nThe career outcome reports alone don't present enough data. Just because Penn has numbers similar to \"other ivies,\" might not in fact capture the sentiment/impact on the ground. Further, we have no way of knowing that if, say, Wharton didn't exist, what impact that would have on the % of CAS students going into finance. If Wharton did NOT exist, would the CAS % to fin/con be lower? Similarly, does the existence of CAS actually depress the # of Whartonites going into fin/con?\nThese are interesting questions, but we have no way of knowing! Further, as no other top school has a top ugrad b-school, comparisons between such schools are ill-founded. It's not a difference in degree - it's a difference in kind.\nOn a related note, your posts imply this: If you want a liberal arts experience similar to the \"other ivies\" Penn CAS has it! If you want an elite u-grad bschool experience embedded in a \"one university\" school, Wharton has it! Further, any interactions between these two schools just enhance the experience!\nSuch a theme again ignores some of the deeply complicated interactions that take place when you have schools with very different missions and educational approaches sitting right next to one another. This analysis also doesn't go into the possibly pernicious consequences of this setup.\nII.) Scholarship/literature that contradicts you:\nThere are some good ethnographic studies/investigative literature that flies in the face of the portrayal you present. For interested parties, I encourage a reading of Karen Ho's \"Liquidated: An Ethnographic Study of Wall Street.\" https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EHNU5R4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\n(You can also google it and find the full text in PDF form.)\n(Interestingly, in opposition to your statement about Penn CAS recruiting strength, Ho argues: \"investment banks do not recruit as heavily from the general [UPenn] undergraduate population as a whole, although ugrads and grads from Penn's renowned Wharton School are among the most highly sought-after recruits. Some college seniors said it was difficult to find investment banking and consulting opportunities without a Wharton pedigree.\" Ho p. 63)\nKevin Roose's \"Young Money: Inside the Hidden World of Wall Street Post-Crash Recruits\" is good too.\n(To investigate wall street recruiting practices, Roose states: \"When looking at schools to visit, I singled out Penn for a reason... 'Penn, and especially Wharton, is in a league of its own,' one hiring manager at a top Wall Street firm told me. 'It's the only place where you go to campus and it's already done and dusted - it's a matter of WHICH financial services firm students want to go to, not WHETHER you want to go into finance.\" Roose p. 16-17)\n(Roose even quotes Penn's head of career services, Patricia Rose, as saying: \"To come to Penn is to, at some point in your undergrad years, ask yourself 'Should I think about investment banking?'\" Roose p. 17)\nI also refer back to the excellent Brandeis study on Penn undergrad culture, that had 1000+ survey participants. That study can be found here: https://www.brandeis.edu/ssri/noteworthy/upenn.html\nPenn student response to the study can be found here: http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/12/brandeis-story-responses\nHere are a couple quotes that the Brandeis researchers thought were representative and salient of the 1000+ survey respondents:\n\"The climate is best suited for people from urban, relatively apolitical, affluent backgrounds who are career-\noriented and very self-motivated toward particular careers. It is alienating for most people who do not fit that model, including students who would prefer to experiment with diverse interests and those who value learning over success. (Junior, White Jewish Male)\" (p. 44 of the Brandeis study)\n\"Biggest note about campus climate is that it is a diverse array of cliques. Frat vs. non-frat, Wharton vs. college, on-campus vs. off-campus, Asian vs. White and perhaps most importantly rich vs. poor. These are all factors that very quickly encourage students to self-select in to homogeneous groups with almost no interaction amongst each other. (Senior, South Asian male)\" (p. 44 of the Brandeis study)\nYes, as @Penn95 will say, these are just the views of two students, but the quotes provided further illustration of the results the researchers found. For instance, Wharton ugrads felt the highest sense of \"belonging\" at Penn (81%, compared to 73% of CAS, and 73% of the nursing school).\nPer all of the above, it very much looks like fin/con holds disproportionate impact at Penn, and the influence of the Wharton school makes Penn differently situated than it's peers, and therefore NOT a good subject of comparison.\nTo quote again the Wall Street hiring manager, who says Penn, especially with Wharton, is \"in a league of its own,\" cuts against @Penn95 attempt to compare Penn to \"other ivies.\" The hiring manager, in fact, does not find it useful to compare Penn to other schools - it's a difference in kind.

But surely you agree that if CAS had a similar percentage of people going to finance/consulting instead of % comparable to other ivies, then something would be really wrong here. Also many people who start out at CAS/SEAS and are interested in business, med up naturally transferring to Wharton, which leaves CAS and seas with a general population less interested in these careers.\nA look at the career services report shows that CAS students are doing quite well for top business recruiting, as are SEAS students. I feel Karen Ho reflects and older opinion, from a few decades ago, before Penn rose up in the rankings, and was revamped. Recruiting opportunities are open to all Penn undergrads and employers look to hire a diverse group. Kevin Roose presents a more up-to-date portrayal of Penn with regards to business recruiting.\nRegarding the quotes you provided, I somewhat agree with the first quote but i completely disagree with the second one. Yes Penn as a whole is not very political, and students are career-oriented, and people tend to be very practical about their studies and their future. At Penn you are forced to think ahead from early on, and create a plan for yourself no matter what you are studying. so in that sense i agree with him.\nThe second one I totally disagree, what he is describing is not the Penn I experienced. What I experienced was a very diverse immunity with people from different backgrounds working together in clubs and organizations and socializing. Yes there were also organizations where groups of a particular background flocked together, but there were at least equally as many that this was not the case.\ni am not surprised about the sense of belonging data. But the difference between Wharton and CAS/Nursing is not big at all.

I'm saying, you can't even do that, because none of the \"other ivies,\" have an undergrad business school, thereby rendering an attempted comparison ill-founded.\nAlso, if you agree with Kevin Roose's view on UPenn business recruiting, you're agreeing, then, that, per Wall Street recruiting managers and multiple other insiders, Penn - generally - is singularly situated as a hotbed for fin/con recruiting. If you agree with this, you should not cite Penn CAS outcome reports in comparison to \"other ivies.\" Rather, you should disclose that Penn seems to be in a singular position, and has a climate that's distinct from anywhere else. (This is, at least, according to the hiring managers cited in Roose's work - at multiple points in the book, hiring recruiters talk about the climate being different at UPenn in comparison to anywhere else.)\nFinally, re disagreeing with the statement about Penn \"cliques\" - your staunch disagreement actually undergirds a point I try to raise continually - Penn's large size makes it increasingly possible for people to have experiences that are completely disparate. You disagree completely with the view another Penn student made regarding the culture, and that's probative - it demonstrates just how different experiences can be.\nNow, I am NOT going to compare UPenn to other schools, but I will assert that, the larger an organization you have, the greater the likelihood that people's experiences can look very different. The fact that the Penn \"clique\" student, @humanbean12 and others have experiences that totally do NOT resonate with you is telling, and follows, again, from the logical assertion that larger organizations tend to have a broader array of experiential offerings to its community members.\nIt's also why it's important, especially when talking about larger orgs, to present as many diverse viewpoints as possible, to stress the complicated nature of these organizations. And I mean this both ways - investigative journalist Kevin Roose, anthropologist Karen Ho, the sociologist Lauren Rivera, the NY Times and New Republic articles, the sociologists behind the Brandeis-UPenn Study, and these other reports all present accounts that contradict your view of Penn as a \"diverse community with people from different backgrounds working together,\" so it's important that you raise this view. It's just as important, then, to present the dominant studies on this subject.\nOn that note, could you point me in the direction of broader studies/reports that conclude UPenn is a \"diverse community with people from different backgrounds working together\"? I have interest in student culture, and I just haven't come across literature (not produced by the University itself) that reaches this conclusion. The main literature I can see, and cite to, concludes the opposite. But I may be looking too narrowly.

It has a fairly rich history (William Carlos Williams is an alum, as is H.G. Bissinger - the Friday Night Lights author), and it's a close-knit dept/major. As @Penn95 said, the Kelly Writers House adds to the close-knit feel. Any given year, there are probably only about 50-70 seniors majoring in English, so you see the same kids in the same classes.\nIn terms of exit options, UPenn has detailed data on this, organized by major. As an example, see what the Class of 2012 English majors did here: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/files/CAScp2012Report.pdf (go to p. 19 for info on English majors)\nAs you can see, the outcomes are fairly varied. This is Penn after all, so some English majors go on to Barclays or Citibank, but some go on to Community Legal Services, publishing jobs, etc. What I loved about this dep't is the outcomes were actually more varied than many other majors/schools at UPenn.\nYou can see a small number go on to graduate school, but I imagine they get a lot of faculty support simply because they are in the minority, and emerge as faculty darlings (faculty like good students who consider the path they themselves took). The English majors all go on to good grad schools (Carnegie Mellon, Yale, USC, etc.).\nI think what you'll find is the small size leads to a lot of opportunities for growth. You'll quickly get to know \"those guys\" - the students who want to pursue academia. There aren't many, but you'll have classes with them, get to connect, and get to see what that life is like. Faculty will support you too.\nHere's the best way I can describe English at UPenn: it's like majoring in History at Johns Hopkins. It may not be one of Penn's \"brand\" schools/majors, but it's extremely good, and actually has carved out a niche/silo for itself that can be a big lifeline for students interested in these topics.\nFinally, it deserves mention that UPenn's incoming Provost, Wendell Pritchett, is a humanities/law guy, and that bodes well for the English department.

Seems that there's always been some great writers walking around Penn's campus. And I'm not so sure that English is as \"under the radar\" at Penn as you might think. There have always been a significant number of English majors at Penn (about 80 per class, the last time I checked, although they don't all necessarily show up in the Career Plans Surveys), and Penn's English Department has long been considered one of the top in the country, going back at least to the early to mid 20th Century. It's almost like saying that Anthropology and the Penn Museum are \"under the radar.\" Maybe for someone who tends to focus on the preprofessional aspects of Penn, but it's important to keep in mind that Penn's College is one of the largest undergraduate liberal arts schools in the Ivy League (along with those at Harvard and Brown), and is as large as or larger than the undergraduate liberal arts components of virtually all of its peers, including your undergrad alma mater.  And Penn's liberal arts programs have long been quite vigorous and eminent, including at the undergraduate level, and they have quite a significant presence among Penn undergrads. I say that based on my own experience as a Penn undergrad (Wharton, actually) in the 1970s, and my kid's experience as an artsy humanities type in the College within the past few years. But certainly, things like KWH and other enhancements in the past 20 years, e.g., Platt Student Performing Arts House, Cinema Studies Program and major, Theatre Arts Program and major, support of the Performing Arts Council and its various components, etc., have given the arts and humanities a higher profile on campus than they had before.

Because, yes,I categorize them very similarly to the English dept - excellent, but not necessarily the most prominent parts of the brand (like history at jhu).\nThat may change for the Penn museum btw - in the fall, the Penn board of trustees decided to invest significant money into the renovation of the space, as a result of architectural/faculty input on the under utilization and lack of maximization of its strength. The idea, as I understand it, is that if it's treated appropriately, the only university museum that matches it is Oxford's.\nSo yes, I analogize these departments to history at jhu because, for those not in the know, they may not think of these areas as gems of the school. For those that operate in humanities circles/in this space, of course, they are well known commodities.\n(On that note, the new econ bldg at 36th and sansom will be a shot in the arm for that department, which is another excellent part of the arts and sciences division.)

For years on this forum, I've occasionally read posts indicating that Penn is not a strong school for anything but Wharton and/or preprofessionalism, whatever THAT may mean in this context, and it simply isn't true. I have to say, though, that I haven't seen that as much recently as in the past.\nIn terms of museums of archaeology, the Penn Museum has long been one of the preeminent such museums in the world, university or otherwise. It's launched more than 300 archaeological expeditions all over the world, and its holdings in several areas are comparable to those of only a select few museums in the world (e.g., the British Museum, National Museum of Iraq, etc.). But the stated goal for some time now has been to upgrade and enhance the visitor experience and museum displays, and ultimately to attract more visitors, so perhaps that's where the comparison to Oxford's museum is relevant.\nAlso, the new building at 36th and Sansom--or actually the renovation of the building at 36th and Walnut and construction of an addition that will more than double the size of the building--will house both the Political Science AND Economics departments (and will be called the Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics). While I'm sure it will be a nice upgrade of space for Economics, the department for which it will really be a shot in the arm is Political Science. Like English, Penn's Econ department has been nationally and international prominent for many decades, and is well known to be one of the top 10 in the country. Political Science, however, has long been a curious outlier in terms of the eminence of Penn's social science departments, usually ranked well out of the top 10, or even top 20 departments in the country. And I say that it's an outlier because Penn's Economics, Sociology, regional studies, and History (a related humanity) programs have long been ranked among the top 10 or so in the country. Which is ironic given that Penn's president is a nationally prominent political scientist. But the new building should build on the strengths of the Econ department and various interdisciplinary programs it shares with Political Science to provide a generous and beautiful space where the synergies can help to elevate both departments (and especially Political Science), and literally raise the profiles of both departments on campus (similar to what the new neuroscience building has done for the physical presence of Psychology, Biology, and neuroscience on campus).

Just as at Stanford (where the faculty /deans openly worry about the school becoming \"the Stanford Institute of Technology,\") or at Hopkins, (a concern about the balance between humanities/medical life science offerings), the portions of the brand that carried disproportionate weight at Penn, historically, have been Wharton and the medical plant.\nNow, the \"from excellence to eminence\" language that Pres. Gutmann evoked has been changing that (along with the success of the past capital campaign, of course), and it's why you see less of that banter now than in the past. Wharton and the medical facilities have always been near-tippy top (read, minor quibbles aside, almost always as in the top handful of places). I believe the recent administrative push and big capital campaign was designed to carry these strengths, but also bring other departments/schools/offices into that \"eminent\" category.\nFor anthropology and the museum, they've been eminent for some time, so they could probably be distinguished from econ/english - although now, especially with investment in the museum, there's a push to broaden their impact. (And yes, increasing museum attendance - and increasing ticket revenue to increase market power, is a goal here.)\nFor English and Econ, I believe they've been excellent for some time, but with the new Perelman bldg I think there are hopes to get UPenn Econ into the very first rung - a position that I'm not sure it currently occupies. (It looks like, currently, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and Stanford, are the biggest heavy hitters here.)\nAlso, thanks for further substantiating my note on the new (or, yes, renovated) bldg at 36th and Sansom - the Perelman bldg will indeed house econ and poli sci.

For decades, it's been a mystery to me why Penn hasn't developed a more eminent poli sci program, since it's really just a matter of paying enough for some academic stars, who would then create a critical mass of top grad students and a faculty full of rising stars. But hopefully this new home will help with a renewed effort to do just that. Poli sci is one of the more popular majors in the College (at least 100 or so majors a year), and when you throw in related and overlapping interdisciplinary majors, such as PPE and IR, you're talking about a significant portion of the College. Plus, as I stated earlier, Penn HAS been strong in fields that poli sci touches upon and interacts with, such as econ, sociology, regional studies, history, etc., not to mention the relevant academic resources of Wharton on the business, finance and management sides. It really is kind of odd that poli sci has been such a relatively weak link. But again, the Perelman Center is hopefully a sign that that's about to change. After all, they DID put poli sci first in the building's name! \nAnd speaking of new buildings on Penn's campus--and getting even a bit further off topic here--have you heard about the new $1.5 billion (yes, billion with a \"b\") hospital building that Penn announced yesterday?

In 2013-14, 31% of men and 28% of women were involved.\nLinks to all frat/sor: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/ofsl/greeklife_chapters.php\nBrandeis study on UPenn student life: https://www.brandeis.edu/ssri/noteworthy/upenn.html (this focuses on Jewish life, but it's a good study - one that shows how different groups of people fit in. Interestingly, by ethnic group, 30-33% of black students, asian students, and hispanic students don't feel like they fit in at UPenn. A minority, of course, but more than some might expect.)\nIf @Penn95 and others will permit me a moment to provide color commentary (but, of course, I will NOT compare Penn to other schools) on the above data:\nPenn is a deeply complicated place, and one that faces myriad cultural problems as a function of its size and decentralized structure. Penn's residential experience is varied and, as the data suggests, there is less of a \"familial\" feel to the college - it is large, and it feels large. Interestingly, in the mental health report, there was no recommendation to bolster residential/dorm support for students, as this isn't typically a strong area for the school. Rather, Penn is pouring more support into its more clinical, administrative support structures - the counseling office, student health office, Division of Public Safety, etc. The expansion of these offices adds to the \"large\" feel of the place.\nTo any incoming student, I say: know yourself, and, just as importantly, know \"your people.\" When you get to Penn, work hard to find \"your people.\" Don't be afraid to branch out, and try new things, but always have a \"home base.\" For some, the home base is the Kelly Writers House. For others, its their themed house/dorm, and for still others, its a certain club or sub-network. Whatever it is, work hard to find it, because when you come to Penn, you won't find a necessarily familial environment. You're going to a school that's as large as a small city, with a lot of people who are in a rush to succeed - don't forget that, and learn how to operate within such an environment.

Everyone is friendless on day one. You don't make friends in 5 minutes, but many of these people will become friends over time if you make a first step here. Everyone is the most open to making new friends early on. Make the most of that opportunity. Go to the pre-orientation activities. Put yourself out there, be friendly, introduce yourself, remember faces and names, engage the other students, ask them questions, listen more, talk less, and don't try to impress them by talking about your achievements.\n2. Join more clubs and activities than you want to be involved in. Some are great, some are boring. Join several and attend them. You can only find the ones that you really like by going. As you get more involved in the good ones, trim back on the uninteresting ones.\n3. Find groups that offer mentoring by upperclassmen. For example, the Women In Computer Science group will assign upperclass mentors to freshmen. These upperclassmen can be an invaluable resource both to guide you in your major and also in finding your peeps socially. Learn from their experience.\n4. There is a significant pre-professional bent at Penn and 45% of the students are in Wharton, SEAS, and nursing. Often these students are very talented, sometimes incredibly talented, but they may not want to have to go to grad school immediately. They want to be able to get a good job after 4 years, and then make a decision on grad school later. They are often planning their next steps from day 1.\nA Wharton student may bring up linkedin profiles, or internship plans, or ask other freshman what your plans are after you graduate. This may seem odd to a liberal arts major who thinks they are there to get an education. A liberal arts major may be more interested talking about Classic Latin, the destruction of Carthage, a book they just read, or music. From my observations, the students who benefit the most from Penn are the students who learn to take in all of it.\nMy D is in SEAS and loves technology. A Wharton student convinced her to create a linkedin profile by the middle of freshman year. She hasn't really needed one, but the good thing is that she has continued to update it once or twice per year, and accumulate information that she might have forgotten. She has also continued to build connections to her Penn friends on Linkedin, and those connects may be helpful in the future. All of that information is captured for the future. Also, when there are career fairs or internship opportunities, the more pre-professional students often make other students aware of opportunities they may have been oblivious to. These students were very helpful to her early on. The point is that there can be value to being award of at least some of the basic pre-professional discussion.\nI agree that many friends come from clubs and common interests, but students are all jumbled up at Penn. Often the friends students make in the dorms or activities are students with not much in common on paper, but who find that their personalities mesh. My D's closest friends cut across schools. They all learn to appreciate the knowledge and abilities of friends who have different interests or abilities from them.@Cue7\nYou are in interesting guy. Some of the things you are saying make perfect sense. Other things are questionable at best.\nI am not sure why you think that the percent of students in greek life is \"ticking up\"? The 2014-2015 data set shows 30% of men and 27% of women in greek life. the 2015-2016 data set appears to omit the percent for men but the number for women is still 27%.http://www.upenn.edu/ir/Common Data Set/UPenn Common Data Set 2014-15.pdf ", "user_id": "699142", "user_name": "Much2learn ", "user_thread_count": "168", "user_comment_count": "4610"}, {"date": {"month": "May", "day": "2,", "year": "2017", "time": "11:31AM"}, "comment": "\n@Much2learn\nWhat am I saying that's questionable?\nRe greek life - I mean ticking up from the past. The Penn Current article had greek life involvement, historically, at 20-25%. Now, it seems a little closer to 30%.\n(Also, to add to my past post, OP, if you're coming to Penn, I encourage you to do some of your own research on finance/consulting (and maybe technology) industries before coming to Penn. Before you know, a chunk of the population will be talking about \"being an analyst\" or \"being a consultant,\" and many have no idea what that means, or the type of work it entails.\nYou can look up some info here: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/library/\nAlso, Vault.com has some good articles on this, and Penn may have a subscription students can use. Read the materials.\nThere are some good (but slanted) books on this too, like this: https://www.amazon.com/Young-Money-Streets-Post-Crash-Recruits-ebook/dp/B00CO7GH54/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493742961&sr=8-2&keywords=kevin+roose\nBefore you know it, certain industries are going to be hosting receptions, and it's easy to get swept up in it.\nThe best advice I can give Penn students is: know yourself, and do your due diligence (on anything - joining a frat, taking a summer job, going to CAPS, etc.).

Rather, Penn seemed to get a lot of students who overachieved in MANY areas (not just one area), and so there was a critical mass of students who felt they needed to push themselves academically, for their singing group, in student government, etc. This was in stark contrast to say, Chicago or Harvard, where there were a fair number of students accepted just because of incredible acumen in one area (be it mathematics, physics, whatever), and that was their core concern. They didn't care how dance recital or their comedy troupe's performance went - they were there to be part of a specific department and culture.\nIn any case, it's interesting to read the Wharton Prof's views!\n(Not sure if I posted this earlier, so apologies if this is redundant.)

Rather, the issue was students trying to excel personally in so many different areas, and thereby creating an atmosphere of considerable stress. I can't even count the number of times undergrads I mentored/tutored weren't free until (literally) 11pm on a Tuesday night, because after class ended at 4:30pm, they had 6 hours of extra-curricular \"work\" to do (student group meetings, dance recital, etc.). If you do that 5-6 days a week, you're bound to end up exhausted and stressed.\nPersonally, I blame Penn's admissions office. They recruit and retain wayyy too much of the \"same\" student - e.g. the business-y engineering student who also was student government president in high school, the cross country runner who is interested in english and was the leader of the high school prom planning committee, the nursing student who was the HS yearbook editor, etc. etc. These students aren't all of a sudden going to STOP being this way when they get to college. Just the opposite - when they're surrounded by all these people who are similar, they're just going to do all this with even MORE intensity.\nFrankly, Penn needs at least some students who just sat around and did math - exceptionally hard math - all day in high school. Or, the student who was a big stats nerd in high school, and their goal at Penn is to take stats classes - hard stats classes - for four years. I never met any kids like this at Penn. They pretty much all fit the archetype I described above.\nEssentially, I saw all this as a function of bad Admissions policy. They don't recruit and retain enough people who were there at Penn for \"one\" (or a couple, or even a few) things. I'm sure there is variety here - but the proportions are way off.\nOf course, not _everyone_ at Penn is this way - but the school has a really high portion (I'd say, a higher portion than almost any other top school) of students who are like this. It's even different from Penn's closest cultural peers - Duke and Northwestern - because, at D and NU, D1 athletics are hyper-serious, and their athletes don't tend to meld with the general student body in quite the same way.\nIt's unfortunate.

Stanford has the Duck syndrome, Penn has the Penn face, Stanford kids are very social, Penn kids are very social, both schools have a strong preprofessional element in addition to strong liberal arts etc.\nI do not think it is reallY unfortunate. Every school has a different culture. Penn is not for everyone. Yes people are very busy but they choose to be this way, they enjoy being very active and doing many different things as well as they can. People do enjoy this kind of environment and in fact there are many social outlets to balance out the heavy academic.research.extracurricular workload. As you said yourself Penn likes people who not only can take this lifestyle but also enjoy it. But that also doesn't mean that there are many kids at Penn who take it a bit easier.\nBut every top school has their own unique culture. For example one should not go to Chicago if they are not ready for insanely hard and stressful academics and limited social life, and they shouldn't go to Columbia if they can't function in a high stress, competitive environment and are overwhelmed by an enormous city like NYC.

But that doesn't mean that there aren't many kids who take it easier.\nAlso it is important to keep in mind what schools Adam grant is comparing Penn to. He did his undergrad at Harvard which is decidedly less competitive/stressful than Pen given the high grade inflation. Also he did his Phd at Michigan and taught at UNC -Chapel Hill which are not as high octane for undergrad as many other top schools. So he doesnt really have a high bar in terms of competitiveness/stress.\nThere are many schools that are thought to be more stressful than Penn by many people: Cornell, Columbia, Chicago, MIT, Caltech come to mind. But each has a different kind of stress.@Cue7 Also I disagree with your painting of Pen students with such a broad brush. Just like Harvard and Chicago as you mention students come to Penn to be part of a culture. It is just that the culture is different. And for most people the extracurriculars do not involve dance and song, they involve much more substantial things, like working with local businesses as consultants to help them grow, tutoring west-chilly kids, having actual jobs with major Philly firms while they are in school etc.\nAlso you timing (right around college decisions) of posting an old article on here that has been posted before, and conveniently bringing in Chicago in your original post, is rather too transparent.

From the Stanford students/grads I met, their tends to be a much higher degree of specialization than what you see at Penn.\nWhat I mean is - at Stanford, if you're an athlete, chances are you're an extremely elite athlete, and your primary reason to be at Stanford is your athletic ability. If you're an engineer or math whiz, you're probably there for your exceptional aptitude in this area. Sure, there are some that are great at both (see NFL QB Andrew Luck), but it's rare.\nAt Penn, where things generally aren't at Stanford's level (be it in athletics or engineering, etc.), students could be good at many things, and that in part creates the very stressful atmosphere - students striving across all areas.\nAdditionally, the Cali location and lack of a nearby city really shift Stanford's culture - I just wouldn't compare it to Penn.\n(For me, the closest cultural comparator to Penn is Northwestern - a school in/near a major urban area, lots of emphasis on well-rounded students, lots of different undergrad schools - like a school of engineering, journalism, music, almost idential undergrad school size, etc.)\nTwo final points:\n1.) Penn's size really amplifies its negative points. Remember, at ~2500 per class, it's 40-60% larger than other top schools. As I've heard some people say about Penn, it's a large school, and it feels large. In some ways that drives people to join more things - to try to make a large school feel smaller by being part of different orgs/groups.\n2.) I can't speak to Columbia, but Chicago is actually a great example of a school that used its admissions policies and administrative clout to address and change the negatives about the school. You characterize Chicago as having \"insanely hard and stressful academics and limited social life\" - and this was true of Chicago 20 years ago. Nowadays, however, that's changed. The school's taken care to change the composition of the student body, to administratively-mandate more grade inflation, and to bolster the social life/housing options to make the experience much better. It's also developed the neighborhood - and there's now a TON more to do around the University than ever before. (More restaurants and cafes, more centralized dorms, a comedy club nearby, etc.)\nChicago is, actually, a model for how a school can change its undergrad culture/experience for the better.\nPenn, on the other hand, hasn't really done this. The admissions policies have remained constant for 20 years - if not longer. They've taken some reactionary steps (expanded their counseling center, expanded their Student Health Center), but I don't think they've done enough to address the problematic parts of the culture head-on.\nThat's why Professor Grant's article and position is so vital - it puts the spotlight on issues the Admissions Office would rather sweep under the rug.

In my experience Stanford kids are as multi-sided, social as Penn kids. Also both student bodies are very entrepreneurial. Stanford kids are definitely not one-sided or overly bookish. Also Penn looks to Stanford as a model. Of course on the whole, Stanford kids and departments are stronger than at Penn, but the same goes for Stanford/Harvard vs Chicago and most other schools.\nMany people say Chicago is stressful even these days and has a nerdy culture and limited social life. Yes it was way worse in the past, but that doesn't mean it is not present still now . Still the culture is more nerdy, grade-deflated, intense, less fun than most ivies. Chicago is simply now trying to be more like an ivy, attract the same kids.\nPenn's size is larger, but that is what many people like about it. it is very diverse and a lot of the learning happens outside of the class through student organizations and opportunities on campus. There are so many student organizations that do amazing things and the heavy involvement of Penn students in them actually is one of the strengths of Penn, not a weakness. It is consistent with Penn's focus on the practical applications of knowledge and of interacting, learning with ones peers. Still one has great access to professors and resources.\nNot saying that there aren't things that need to be fixed at Penn, but a lot of the things you don't like about Penn, there are many other people that do like and choose Penn specifically because of it. The same people absolutely don't like the culture at Chicago. It is a matter of preference and people make their choices accordingly.

Stanford v. Penn: my sample size here is small, but I see two main types of Stanford students: 1.) the \"Penn-type student\" on steroids (think Andrew Luck, the NFL QB, or soccer star Jordan Morris - really good students who were exceptional athletes) and 2.) the math whizzes/comp sci phenomenon/harvard types - people who are probably close to genius levels, and picked Stanford over places like Caltech, Harvard, and MIT.\nThe issue is, at Penn, the first type student is disproportionately present (the overachiever in many areas), but not to such an extreme degree (e.g. no potential pro athletes, Olympians, etc.), and the second type student just isn't there enough. On aggregate, then, the atmosphere at Stanford is quite different then Penn. Maybe if you combined Penn, Harvard, Northwestern/Duke (for its higher-level athletics), and Caltech, you'd get what Stanford has. Just looking at Penn v. Stanford alone, however, is a poor comparison.\nIf, on the other hand, you're saying the chief connecting point is \"multi-sided, social\" kids, why on earth is Stanford a better comparator than Northwestern, for Penn? Northwestern has a much more similar college size, is close to an urban area, has a similar greek life investment to Penn, and very similar admissions policies.\nI'm not saying there aren't ANY similarities between Penn and Stanford - there clearly are. I just think there are much better comparators to Penn than Stanford.\nB.) Re Penn's current structure/culture being a selling point: I'm not critiquing Penn's infrastructure for student life, and there's nothing that can be done about its (IMO) overly large size for an elite college. What I AM saying is that, when we look in the rearview mirror, I hope the culture looks better, improved, and not simply more intense.\nIn reality, though, I don't think that's what's happening. You note that \"Many people say Chicago is stressful even these days and has a nerdy culture and limited social life. Yes it was way worse in the past, but that doesn't mean it is not present now either.\" Well, that's still improvement, no? You say yourself that it was \"way worse in the past,\" which means that the culture has gotten better.\nIn opposition to this, I actually think Penn's culture gets worse every year - because every year, admissions gets just a little tighter, and they accept kids who are just a little more accomplished, so every year the screws turn a little more.\nI think Penn's culture was actually better 15 years ago - back when it had a broader SAT band (maybe 1250-1450?) and students coming in were less uniformly accomplished. When I speak to my peers who still work at Penn, they say the culture is \"the same, only even more intense.\" Many (who now are in admin or teaching roles at Penn) share Wharton Prof Adam Grant's views, by the way.\nThat's not a good thing.

The whiz kids you mention are primarily preset at Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Caltech. And maybe very few at Yale, Princeton. The rest of the top schools get a tiny share of the whiz kids. In fact Penn gets the finance, business, entrepreneurship whiz kids or the super impressive kids who interested in business/entrepreneurship that would have otherwise gone to HYPSMC.\nMaybe the culture at Chicago has gotten better, but then again it could only get better, and better is relative. Better than before does not mean better than other schools.\nPenns culture does not get worse every year. In fact the culture is becoming more open, people are more willing to talk about failure and not keep the Penn face and open up to each other. And there have been many initiatives started in the last 3-4 years to encourage these things.\nMaybe Pen is slightly too big, but as you see many top schools (Yale, Stanford, i think Princeton too) are expanding their students bodies. There are benefits from having a larger student body. At Penn the size is still manageable and it still allows meaningful interaction with professors and great access to resources and opportunities.\nThe Penn culture is not more intense than many other top schools. That is simply not true. It is just different. Yes it is more intense compared to Brown, Yale, Dartmouth, Harvard sure. But is it not more intense compared to MIT, Columbia, Chicago, Cornell, Caltech. Most would say these schools are more intense/stressful than Penn.

Stanford v. Penn - Why is Stanford the best comparator (in your view) to Penn, as opposed to Duke or NU? Also, of the three, why isn't Northwestern clearly the best comparator? I still think NU is (by far) the best comparator because it is, structurally and situationally, so similar to Penn.\nThe sports aren't quite as intense at NU (just like Penn, and in contrast to Stanford and Duke), the size is almost identical (important, because Duke and Stanford are considerably smaller colleges), the admissions policies are strikingly similar (both schools look for similar types of kids, are similarly selective), both have pre-professional undergraduate schools (Wharton, nursing, and engineering at Penn, journalism, engineering, music, etc. at NU), heck, even the weather is similar (Chicago is colder, of course, but Phila is much closer to Chicago re weather than Palo Alto or Durham!).\nThe lack of the same proportion of whiz kids also puts Stanford in a different category for me. Yes, Penn gets its fair share, as do Columbia, Brown, Duke, etc., but there's a reason why Stanford (and Harvard and a couple others) generally occupy different air space.\n2.) Chicago's cultural changes: you state that, \"Maybe the culture at Chicago has gotten better, but then again it could only get better, and better is relative.\"\nI disagree that the culture \"could only get better.\" To the contrary, it takes a lot of work (and money!) to change the culture - the easiest thing to do is let the culture languish or, perhaps, even get worse. I think we'd both agree that no school has seen as much change as Chicago over the past decade - it's moved at hyper-speed to get many changes done. In the past 10 years its revamped its admissions policies, changed the composition of the student body, created pre-professional pathways, added all sorts of amenities and supports, etc.\nAlso, note, I'm NOT trying to compare Penn directly to other schools - at least not to an officious degree. Rather, I'm wondering whether the school is becoming a better version of itself, and/or whether it should modulate some of its composition.\n3.) Penn now v. Penn before: more articles like this have proliferated about Penn in the past few years than ever before:http://www.phillyvoice.com/12th-suicide-less-4-years-hits-upenn-report-says/http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/03/mental-health-at-penn-2015-task-forcehttps://billypenn.com/2016/04/27/pressure-of-perfection-the-stigma-of-suicide-and-mental-health-at-penn/\nThese are case-by-case, intense, and tragic situations, but they are jarring to read about as an alum, as someone still quite connected to the school. Make no mistake, this has always been a problem at Penn - but it's especially amplified now.\nYes, the school has made some (reactionary) steps to address this - but, as is true of many admins, it's been just that - reactionary. Some of this, as well, is on the margins - few address it as directly as Professor Adam Grant.\nI'm not sure exactly how the culture now is better than before. CAPS has expanded, SHS (health services) has expanded, but that comes lock step with increased admissions selectivity, stagnant admissions policies, and no real admin push (and $$) to foster cultural change.\nCan you point to structural/policy changes and the concurrent SPENDING associated with these changes, that have improved the school? Is Penn now looking for a different archetypal student? Have they spent millions encouraging \"non-traditional\" employers to come to campus to fight the \"pre-professional\" vibe? Has Penn's contribution to \"non-traditional\" channels for post-grad work (like the Peace Corps) or deep-knowledge areas of study (like PhD programs) increased markedly in the past few years? Please point me in the direction of these changes.\nSimilarly, if I look back at career outcome reports in the career office - will I see changes over the past 5-10 years, or consistency?\n(Career outcome reports available here: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/reports.php, and they look remarkably consistent to me.)\nUntil then, I see a university that is pouring hundreds of millions into its research plant/feeder pathways, and showing unfortunate complacency to the culture present in the undergraduate community.

(social life, students with many interests, duck syndrome/penn face, entrepreneurial student body, big focus on involvement on-camus organization ). They also have a similar academic philosophy, new initiatives (start-up incubators, dual degree programs, practical application of knowledge). I agree that Duke is very similar in many of these ways, but Penn and Stanford are definitely very similar in all of these ways.\nI don't think that Chicago has anything that extraordinary. They have decided to become more like am ivy, have really gamed the USNews rankings, bombarded applicants with promotional materials, and started to morph themselves into an ivy and go after the same students as the ivies. They have gone into huge best to finance all of this and the new facilitiesamenities you mention. But that doesnt mean the schools doesnt have many of the issues it had in the past, severe grade deflation, anemic social life (even people nowadays say that), and just really intense academics.\nYes Penn has expanded CAPS, has organized and funded many organizations such as Penn Wellness, launched a mental health hotline, student organizations like Active Minds, CAPS Advisory Board. a;so the students have taken initiative to be more open about failure http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/wall-of-rejection-now-in-annenberg\nAlso Penn has spent millions and millions in revamping the campus and creating an even better campus environment adding all sorts of new amenities.\nRegarding admissions and careers, Penn has completely overhauled the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowship to provide more support to students interested in pursuing rides, marshall etc scholarships. and they have had great results (in the last decadeit has had the same number of rhodes scholars as columbia (6) and not much worse than chicago (10).\nWhy should there be such drastic changes? I dont think you should expect to see any rapid changes in career outcomes/preferences, like you don't see any changes in most other top schools. Chicago is an exception because they have decided to make themselves look more like an ivy so they needed a big overhaul. But for the rest, why should there be a change?

Responding to your post #4, where you say: \"your timing (right around college decisions) of posting an old article on here that has been posted before, and conveniently bringing in Chicago in your original post, is rather too transparent. Just saying.\"\nYou've seen the threads where I've been accused of being the biggest UChicago pessimist around, right? In fact, I think you've actually posted on threads where I've been named as a \"grump/cynic\" about Chicago. Some of that is in fact true - I assess my college alma mater with a very skeptical view, and I have a fairly negative view of many of the things going on at Chicago.\nGiven that you know this, to imply that I'm making some sort of play here for Chicago is pretty rich. I have, at best, an ambivalent relationship with Chicago, and this would actually be the worst year to try to woo Chicago admits from other schools (as Chicago accepted so much of the class ED, they have only a tiny number of cross-admits with other schools - I'd be wasting my energy here).\nAll this being said, I actually think you're underselling the profound shift Chicago's been able to orchestrate in a short period of time. It's about much more than lots of marketing and \"gaming\" US News - Chicago backed this all up with a huge investment (a huge bet!) on its College. It took on more debt DURING the great recession because it felt the College could pay dividends down the line. So far, the plan seems to be paying off in spades. The college is probably healthier and more viable than it ever has been, and the #3 US News ranking (merited or not) marks the first time a non-HYPMSCaltech school is in the top 3 in at least the past 20-30 years.\n(Also, I think it's too simplistic to say Chicago is trying to be more \"ivy-like\" - the ivies are not a monolith, and I don't think Chicago is trying to be like Penn or Brown or Dartmouth or Cornell - it seems, rather, to be trying to keep its ethos while emulating some of Yale's community-focused characteristics, and Columbia's urban research center approach.)\nNOW, all that aside - I retract my original two comparators with different student populations - how about instead of saying \"Chicago or Harvard,\" I say \"Penn is in stark contrast to Swarthmore or Harvard\"? Perhaps that would've solved this whole sidebar!\n2.) @Boothie007 and @IWannaHelp - I'm not sure why @Penn95 is so steadfast in targeting Stanford as Penn's closest \"cultural peer.\" Frankly, this caught me off guard. When I was at Penn, the schools I heard talked about the most as comparators were Cornell and Duke, and I drew the comparison to Northwestern a lot just because I knew NU fairly well, and it struck me as so similar to Penn.@Penn95 said that, from the NU to Penn transfers s/he met, they said NU was more academic/one focus. Maybe that's true, but to me, knowing NU, this still seems more like a difference in degree from Penn, NOT a difference in kind. The higher proportion of Caltech/MIT level geniuses walking around Stanford, combined with a higher degree of specialization amongst the the Stanford students (they had more kids walking around whose goal and chief reason for being there was, say, swimming or football or soccer) makes me see it as a difference in KIND from Penn, not a difference of degree.\n3.) Finally, @Penn95 - you note that Penn students do more than just \"song and dance\" as extracurriculars, and this is absolutely true. I don't mean to undermine that at all. What I mean to say, though, is this - I was surprised by the level of intensity surrounding such a wide range of extra-curriculars, and I was puzzled as to why students spent so much time on them. You know this as well as I do - singing groups like the Penn Glee Club and Penn Masala, comedy troupes like Mask and Wig, and a host of other clubs are a big deal. There are tryouts, intense rounds of interviews, and huge time investments into all this. Same thing goes for externships, student government elections, etc.\nStudents don't compete with each other, but they exist in an environment where there are competitive application processes and pathways, and that just creates a of stress.\nNOTE: I'm NOT saying that other top schools aren't stressful. That's far from my point. I'm also not trying to say Penn has more stress than other schools. I'm trying to say that Penn, when looked at singularly, has a cultural problem, one that's been documented in many places, by many people (Wharton's Adam Grant included) and this seems to be a more recent (past 5-10 yr) trend.\nJust because people don't compete with each other doesn't mean an environment isn't competitive, and just because other schools have issues doesn't mean Penn shouldn't be pouring more into improving this.

That will surely add great value to prospective students trying to consider whether or not to go to Penn and its peers... 8-|\nWhen i was considering whether or not to matriculate at Penn i was happily and primarily choosing between Penn, Yale, and Columbia. I considered Northwestern (and actually spent the better part of 5 months there during high school) but ultimately it was too dissimilar from the other three because it's suburban location and participation in the Big 10. To compare evanston to west philadelphia/NYC/New Haven is one of the most absurd things I've ever seen. Evanston is not urban and by any city dweller's standards, it's not even 'near' Chicago-- which is to say that it's in a rich, primarily white suburb of Chicago. West Philly, on the other hand, is a vibrant and integral component of the city's fabric. Let's not compare taking public transportation/a shuttle to Chicago every once in a while with living in America's 5th largest city every day of your life. And being in the big 10 gives northwestern a very different vibe. Granted, Northwestern is NOT michigan or Ohio State. But the Penn Quakers would literally break their vow against violence to get a turnout to their football games that looked ANYTHING like what happens at Northwestern. Yes, northwestern has a school of journalism and a certificate in business or whatever-- so what? Georgetown actually has almost the exact same schools as Penn (nursing, college, business and then Gtown has SFS) and it's actually IN a city (well.. it's basically in a city)-- there's much more fertile ground for cultural comparisons there. But Penn just isn't like schools that aren't embedded in America's Acela Corridor-- the geography is just too powerful an influence on how students interact and what they do with their free time. It even influences the way they see their campuses and educations in the context of the world outside.\nOn the other hand, culturally Penn was most similar to Columbia in the ways that mattered to me. Both were products of the cities that housed them and they both had gorgeous urban campuses. Columbia/Barnard has 11,286 full time undergrad students and Penn has 10,468 full time undergraduate students making them near twins in size (you can't discount Barnard students when considering campus culture since they are a prominent part of Columbia's culture. They take classes at, join clubs at, and use Columbia's resources and Columbia students do the same at Barnard). Both schools were exceptionally pre-professional (a disproportionate number of grads go into finance, consulting, engineering and professional school at both) but centered around two of the most robust liberal arts colleges in higher education. The students were smart and social but not nerdy in that ~Princeton~ way. They were acutely aware that their educations were in the context of a world that preexisted the creation of their institutions and that had profound affects beyond the boundaries of their campuses on a map. Both schools had a proud tradition of being home to some of the absolute best and historically significant professional schools in the world (Wharton, Columbia Law, Penn Med, SIPA) and each school was clearly influenced by the strength of those grad schools in genuinely enriching ways. Yet both had undergraduate student bodies that remained central foci of the universities as wholes. Both student bodies felt like they were full of self-starters and go-getters. There was just an energy and enthusiasm that permeated their bustling, pre-professional, urban campuses full of rock-star students with ambition and an eye for what was happening in the real world as much as for what was happening in the classroom.\nUltimately I felt Penn was a better fit for me because while it shared those cultural and structural commonalities with Columbia, it had more of the campus oriented feel and community oriented atmosphere that I associate more with Yale. I felt like Penn was the perfect balance between Columbia and Yale and increasingly I'm surprised by how right I was!\nAlso lol @ the people talking about the special geniuses gracing the halls of Harvard and Stanford and \"maybe Yale and Princeton.\" Y'all are talking about 17-22 year olds with basically identical SAT scores, GPAs, and high school accomplishments... Sure Harvard has its zuckerbergs and Penn has its Elon Musks... but the vast majority of kids at these schools (yup, all of 'em) are intellectually identical. It's their attitudes, personalities and ambitions that set them apart.

The data we have doesn't support your statement. Stanford undergrad, for example, produces about twice as many PhDs per capita than Penn, as seen here: https://www.pomona.edu/sites/default/files/bacorigins_2003-2012.pdf (about 11% of Stanford undergrads go on to get a PhD, compared to 5.5% of UPenn grads).\nStanford's PhD production rate is actually much closer to Yale (12.5%) or Brown (11%) (schools with less pre-professional vibes) than to Penn.\nTo me, PhD placement shows what chunk of the student population is NOT interested in pre-professional pursuits.\nBy the way, do you want to know which top school has the closest PhD production to UPenn? Northwestern - at 6.7% in comparison to Penn's 5.5%.\n2.) Also, the structure of Stanford's college shifts the culture there too - it's set up much more similarly to Harvard (with a school of Humanities, Science, and then Engineering) as opposed to Penn, which has many more directly professional undergradaute schools (business, nursing, and engineering). This also changes (dampens?) the pre-professional vibe on Stanford's campus.\n3.) Student composition: your main argument is, both schools have students that are \"social and also very academically and pre-professionally motivated.\" Well, whoop-tee-do. This is weak sauce when you compare the culture of student populations - and blend in the structure of the schools and data we have on the subject. Stanford seems to have considerably more people interested in academic careers than Penn, a lack of purely pre-professional undergrad schools (outside of engineering), and an admissions policy that results in a sizable chunk of the population (math whizzes, Caltech types) that would rarely - if ever - choose Penn. On aggregate, then, this decreases Stanford's standing as a comparator to Penn, vis a vis other schools (like Northwestern, or Cornell, or Duke).\nAgain, if the criteria is \"\"social and also very academically and pre-professionally motivated,\" there are so many other schools that fit the bill.\nFinally, if you want to talk curriculum and cross-disciplinary structure, Stanford's lack of professional undergrad schools actually puts it BEHIND Penn here - there's lots more cross-disciplinary activity at Penn than Stanford. Stanford's cross-disciplinary work at the undergrad level actually resembles Harvard more - where someone could double major in, say, Comp Sci and Classics, or theater and symbolic systems. Lots of schools are cross-discplinary, but Stanford has a much more \"classical\" set of educational offerings than Penn, and that detracts from the practical cross-disciplinary offerings presented. You can't combine business education and engineering at Stanford, or become a nurse with course work in accounting. Stanford has none of that.

Would you discount Professor Grant's analysis simply because he didn't go to Penn undergrad? In some ways, professors (and others, like post-docs, admins, grad student tutors, etc.) are ideally positioned to assess their student population.\nAlso, this thread is becoming an echo chamber because the only two Penn undergrad alums posting are you and @Penn95 - two very happy grads. Your views may be rosier than many of your compatriots.\nAnyway, there seems to be a lot more focus on cultural problems present at Penn - from the Adam Grant article to the other articles I posted, to a long expose from the NY Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/stress-social-media-and-suicide-on-campus.html), the list goes on. Much of this has arisen in the past 5-7 years. When I was at Penn in the 2000s, there really was very little of this.\nAlso, I'm searching, but I can't find such exposes/critiques about Brown, Swarthmore, etc. etc.\nFinally, you state: \"Sure Harvard has its zuckerbergs and Penn has its Elon Musks... but the vast majority of kids at these schools (yup, all of 'em) are intellectually identical.\"\nBut that's just not true. Harvard has a higher number of \"off the charts\" students per capita than Penn. Let's use National Merit Scholar awards as an example of those students who are coveted.http://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/images/gid2/editor_documents/annual_report.pdf?gid=2&pgid=61\nIn 2016, Harvard had 233 of them, in comparison to 138 at Penn, even though Penn is 40% larger than Harvard!\nOr, look at the Putnam math winners: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition#Winners\nA very small band of schools - those that typically accumulate the premier math talent in the country - dominate the list.\nI don't think it's \"attitude, personalities, and ambition\" that's setting them apart - Harvard, Stanford, etc. simply get a higher proportion of students with more intellectual horsepower. I'm sure if you looked at # of intel science award winners, Google science fair, Siemens Competition, whatever, a disproportionate number of students go to a handful of schools. And guess what? Penn (and Cornell and Duke and Columbia and others) aren't in that small handful.\nOn aggregate, then, certain schools are amassing more talent than others.\n(The same, by the way, goes for the amassing of faculty talent - if you look at the number of nobel laureates, mcarthur fellows, etc. at Harvard and Stanford, it really is quite astounding. These two schools alone have amassed perhaps the greatest concentration of research talent in human history.)

See here: https://facultysenate.stanford.edu/past-senates/40th-faculty-senate/40th-senate-minutes (go to p. 16 of the June 12, 2008 minutes).\nIn this report, Stanford Admissions Dean Richard Shaw presents cross-admit data to faculty, and shows how many cross admits choose other schools. How much does Penn get? 2% of the cross admits. This is less than USC, and really not that different from Rice, UCLA, Brown, or any other school. It's a negligible amount.\nWharton and all those dual degree programs don't even seem to make an impression to those Stanford and UPenn cross-admits. Stanford's only losing 2% of cross-admits to Penn.\nIn terms of real numbers: of the ~2100 Stanford accepts a year, about 400 choose to go elsewhere. About 280 of the 400 (70%) choose HYPM. How many go to Penn? 2% - or about 8 students. This is nothing, and, isn't a larger share than many other schools.\nIt's contentions like @Penn95's that disappoint me. Certain positions are presented strongly (like Penn getting the most Stanford cross-admits after the non-HYMP schools) or as @PennCAS2014 said, the caliber of student is virtually identical at Harvard and Penn.

Remember, Penn undergrad has (literally) HUNDREDS of clubs (or RSOs - registered student orgs), so you could fill pages on a new thread to talk about the competitive ones.\n(To get you started, my knowledge here is old, but as I recall, here are some competitive clubs/orgs that require interviews, lots of campaigning, tough tryouts, etc.: UA [undergrad student gov't], Parliamentary Debate team, Model UN, Mock Trial, Glee Club, Penn Masala [South Asian A Cappella], Penn Dhamaka [south asian dance], Quaker Notes [a cappella], Off the Beat [a cappela], lots of the investment/consulting clubs - especially the Wharton ones, a lot of the competitive club/jv sports teams, like sprint football, club field hockey, rugby, etc., Mask and Wig Club [comedy troupe], Daily Pennsylvanian [student newspaper - not sure how competitive they are any more], lots of the governance/oversight councils, like the student-run Student Activities Council, etc.)\nReally, a discussion of clubs deserves its own thread.

If you were actually a Penn undergrad i the last 5-6 years you would know that there are many dual degree and Wharton kids who choose Penn over HYPSM. Also USC as you say could be chosen due to location, but from the non-HYPSM elite schools, Penn does get the biggest part of the cross admits. Also a look through CC shows that there are many threads of people debating Stanford/Harvard vs Penn dual degrees. Btw there are more dual degrees than just M&T.\nAlso btw the average student at all the top 10 or so schools is pretty much the same, What Harvard or Stanford differ is that their top 5-10% consist of the super genius prodigious, something which is much less true in the other top schools.\nWhat is the blatant misinformation that I have spread?\nWhat is not a good look is trying so hard to find things that are wrong with Penn. Recycling old articles and making gross exaggerations and generalizations of the student body. You almost look like you have an agenda.@kimfuge88 lol says the Duke or NU or whatever you are...from my anecdotal experience students in these schools get really insecure that they did not go to an ivy. so of course you would ask that question..\nAnd yes Adam Grant is awesome, I had him as a professor.

Let me present more recent data that further undermines your baseless points re competitiveness between Penn and Stanford:https://facultysenate.stanford.edu/past-senates/43rd-faculty-senate/43rd-senate-minutes\nGo to p. 20 of the October 7, 2010 Stanford Faculty Minutes in the above link.\nPer that report from Stanford's Admissions Dean Richard Shaw, UPenn did not make the list of top 12 universities that share the highest percentage of cross-admits with Stanford. (Berkeley was the most common cross-admit school, with 27% of Stanford admits earning acceptance to Cal. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Duke, USC, UCSD, and Brown were also popular cross-admit schools. No other schools had more than 10% of cross-admits with Stanford.)\nBased on Dean Shaw's data. no more than 10% of Stanford's acceptances in 2010 were also accepted to UPenn.\nFurther, Dean Shaw noted that, outside of HYPM, no school took more than 2% of Stanford's admits. So, at least as recently s 6.5 years ago, Penn had absolutely no improvement in their \"competition\" with Stanford.\nSince 2010, Stanford has only gotten MORE competitive in terms of admissions. In 2010, for example, its overall yield was about 72%. Now, it's about 82%.\nDo you really think, as everything at Stanford has only gotten STRONGER in the past 6 years, that Penn is doing BETTER now than 6.5 years ago? With Stanford's yield up 10% in 6 years, and, traditionally, 70% of cross-admits who deny Stanford going to HYPM, how could UPenn possibly be improving here?\n2.) You ask if I have an \"agenda.\" Initially, no, I had no agenda - either on this board or the Chicago board (my two frequent posting sites). Of late, however, I keep reading all the bombastic posts (with incomplete analysis) you make about Penn (and, similarly, all the pompous assertions @Chrchill makes about Chicago), and it's important to present readily available data that provides crucial counterpoints and perspective.\nMake no mistake, I have no problem with Penn - I'm lucky enough to be an alum, and if I never matriculated, I'd never have discovered my fav college greasy spoon - the Greek Lady in West Philly. I enjoyed my time there, and it's a good school.\nI do have a problem with assertions you make that have no basis, that artificially inflate Penn's standing. So far on this thread, you've said that Penn gets the greatest share of Stanford admits of non-HYPM schools, but you present no data for this. The most recent data I have, on the other hand, shows just how irrelevant Penn is in Stanford's cross-admit pool. Further, you argue that, recently, \"more east coast kids\" are applying to Stanford, but, as recently as 6 years ago, Penn wasn't even in the top 12 of cross-admit schools with Stanford.\nYou never present data to back up what seem to be hunches found in skewed places - like College Confidential, or \"what you hear\" around campus.\nHonestly, are you a little surprised that, per a report to faculty, Stanford takes 98% of cross-admits from Penn? How much better do you think the situation has gotten for UPenn when Stanford has surpassed even Harvard for selectivity and yield in the past few years?\nYour ability to take data that convincingly shows Penn's irrelevance and then spin it into something meekly positive is both astounding and absurd.\nHere's the highest compliment I can give you: I hope UChicago's admissions department hires you soon. You're just the sort of marketer they've been accumulating over the past few years, as they continually try to show their (false) relevance next to Stanford, Harvard, et. al.\n(And, come to think of it, maybe Penn should hire @Chrchill as an admissions rep - his comments about Penn students' bartending skills are amusing - and remind me of running into Penn undergrads at Feb Club - a month of meaningless drinking for Penn seniors!)\n3.) Oh, and finally - if you had a class with Adam Grant, you know how awesome he is, AND how perceptive/insightful he is. If he says Penn's culture is the worst he's ever seen, that should be taken very, very seriously. Along with Angela Duckworth, Grant is probably one of Penn's most important, prized professors. (Let's hope Harvard or Stanford don't poach him soon, eh?)\nGrant's devoted his life's work to these sorts of issues, and he's about as perceptive a guy as I've ever met, and that includes, ahem, the numerous nobel prize winners I met at Chicago.

We discussed our similarities at our ivy only debate tournaments. Now we chill together at the companies we all work for with one another and the Ivy League grad schools we all attend. We enjoy each other's company at our ivy-only social gatherings, mixers, galas, etc. Sure, sometimes we make fun of Brown students for barely having to attend class and yeah we poke fun at the Princeton kids for being weirdos-- but at the end of the day we know we're all pretty much cut from the same cloth. I'm not saying that certain schools don't have higher proportions of students with particular interests. It sounds like from what you posted that more kids at Harvard *really* like math.

They recruit and retain wayyy too much of the \"same\" student.\"\n\"Penn needs at least some students who just sat around and did math - exceptionally hard math - all day in high school.\"\nWhile the article was about Penn, I do not believe that Penn students are under any more stress than students at MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cal Tech, Swarthmore, Princeton, JHU, Columbia, Yale, Cornell, Yale, or Chicago. None of this is really about Penn per se. Oddly, many of the same people who say Penn students are under too much pressure to study also criticize Penn for spending too much time partying. I don't get it.\nOn other threads you attack Penn and argue that its admits are inferior to Chicago because of their slightly lower test scores, but Penn has always put more weight on gpa, and extracurriculars, and less weight on test scores compared to other Ivies or Chicago. Most years, you will find that Penn has the highest gpa average of any Ivy. In contrast, Chicago touts their students' test scores, but refuses to publish a Common Data Set or gpa data. Perhaps Chicago grabs high test scores to puff up their ranking, and then hides the gpa data to cover their tracks.\nI understand that you are a U Chicago fan and don't like Penn's pragmatic approach to education. You think Penn should be admitting more \"life of the mind\" single-interest students who just want to read books. Chicago has made efforts in recent years to move away from its self-created \"where fun comes to die\" stereotype, but they are still fighting many of their own alums over it, who prefer the old approach and think the administration has \"gone soft.\" In contrast, Penn's educational approach is a practical balance between book learning and hands-on doing. That was established 140 years before Chicago was born, by Penn's founder, Benjamin Franklin. Ben loved books and was mostly self-educated, but also realized the limitations of books without hands-on, practical experience and experimentation.\nPenn does tend to admit students who are engaged, involved, well-rounded, and tend to be sociable. They also tend to be bright, naturally curious doers, who want to get a great education in a place where students are engaged, and classes are only a portion of the experience. They want to also have great experiences, and also enjoy their 4-year experience where they have built life-long relationships. They want it all and are willing to work hard to have it all. It does mean being very busy, but they like it that way.\nChicago is great. Students get an amazing education there. I would happily send the right kid there. I don't see Chicago as better or worse than Penn, just very different. What I do not understand is why a Chicago backer wants to come to the Penn forum and post an old article that is critical of Penn on the day before students' decisions are due. My only guess is that you don't think your school can compete effectively for top talent on its own merits, and to improve its chances, you think you need to make a weak attempt to tear down Penn. That is unfortunate.

In the process you exaggerate/distort most of them.

But it is just not a force in academic subjects, especially in many graduate departments.\n\nAs my good friend @Cue7 is probably aware, I haven't posted much on this forum for quite some time (just occasional informational posts here and there), but @Chrchill has expressed this at least twice in this thread (and perhaps elsewhere), and I think it might be time for a factually based rebuttal to this assertion. In FACT, many of Penn's graduate departments are INDEED a force in \"academic\" subjects as you refer to them, having been continuously ranked among the top 10 or 20 graduate programs in the country for many decades. For example, the National Research Council (NRC) rankings of Ph.D programs--among the most widely respected of such rankings in the academic community--ranked many of Penn's \"academic\" departments among the top 10 or 20 both in the early 1990s, and again in the most recent NRC rankings a few years ago:https://www.stat.tamu.edu/~jnewton/nrc_rankings/nrc41indiv.htmlhttp://www.chronicle.com/article/NRC-Rankings-Overview-English/124728/\nA survey of the early '90s NRC rankings reveals Penn's Ph.D programs to have been ranked among the top 10 in 14 different areas: Art History, English, French, Linguistics, Music, Religion, Spanish, Neurosciences, Physiology, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science, Anthropology, Economics, and Psychology. Further, Penn was ranked just outside of the top 10 in 5 additional areas--Classics (#13), Comparative Literature (#11), Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior (#14), History (#12), and Sociology (#11)--and among the top 15-20 in another 4 areas: German (#16), Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (#16), Molecular & General Genetics (#19), and Physics (#17).\nSo to summarize, out of the hundreds of Ph.D programs in 41 different areas, Penn was ranked among the top 10 in 14 areas, the top 15 in another 5 areas, and the top 20 in still another 4 areas.\nAlso, in ITS rankings of graduate programs based on departmental reputation, US News has consistently ranked several of Penn's \"academic\" programs among the top 10 or so in the country. For example, it most recently ranked Penn's graduate program in English as tied for #3 in the country with Columbia and Stanford, below only UC-Berkeley and Chicago, and ABOVE Harvard, Princeton, and Yale:https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/english-rankings?int=a58a09&int=a06908\nIt also ranked Penn's graduate program in Psychology as tied for #8 with Princeton, MIT, and others, and well above Columbia and Chicago, both tied at #17 with several other schools:https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/psychology-rankings?int=a58a09&int=a06908\nTo my mind, that Penn has had at least 14 graduate programs ranked as top-10 in diverse \"academic\" areas, and another 9 graduate programs ranked as top-20 in additional diverse areas, would tend to belie the statement that Penn \"is just not a force in academic subjects, especially in many graduate departments.\" Maybe it's not Harvard , but I'd maintain that Penn is certainly still \"a force in academic subjects.\" But that's just me. \nIn any event, carry on folks--I've been enjoying reading the sparkling repartee.

If you review the graduate program rankings that I discussed, I think you'll find that Penn is quite comparable to Columbia in terms of the number of \"academic\" graduate programs ranked in the top 10 and top 20, so your construct of there being 4 \"greater\" Ivies of HYP and Columbia and, presumably, 4 \"lesser\" Ivies of Penn and the rest, is also without merit. Add to this that Penn's professional schools are, as you acknowledge, generally among the very best, and that Penn's endowment is now $10.72 billion compared to Columbia's $9.04 billion (making Penn's the 4th largest endowment in the Ivy League and the first after HYP to reach double digits in billions), and the assertion that Columbia is at some sort of level with HYP that Penn is not, becomes even more tenuous. Penn and Columbia are quite comparable in every way (except perhaps for name recognition among the general public), and the notion that Columbia is in a class above Penn is, quite frankly, extremely dated.

My parents are willing to contribute 35-40K/year, but no more...thus far, financial aid appeals have not been fruitful.\nTo add some context, the reasons I worry about W&L are as follows:\n1) Lack of a dedicated applied math/stats department; to a lesser extent, an accredited engineering curriculum. I'm very interested in applied math and stats. I eventually want to go into a job in the data science field...how easy is it to get into the field right after graduating from a liberal arts college such as W&L? Or, would I need to go to grad. school first?\n2) A possibly too relaxed/not ambitious enough of a student body...\n3) The bucolic setting (albeit exceptionally beautiful) isn't ideal...but I would enjoy it nonetheless.\n4) Perhaps too small of a student body with too much of a boarding school feel.\nTo add, my parents would be able to continue supporting my equestrian pursuits (actually to a much greater degree) if I attend W&L. At other schools, this is unlikely, even impossible. This equestrian sport availability would definitely play a big role in keeping me \"happy\" at college, but it's not a factor directly derived from the educational experience, so I don't know if it's worth considering in this dilemma.\nMany thanks!

Being admitted to Penn is the chance of several lifetimes. Make the best of it!\nRegarding your questions:\n\"1) I will be attending the College of Arts and Sciences and I put Political Science as my anticipated major but I am uncertain as of now. Will I be able to change majors if I wanted to or am I too late? I really want to get into politics and government when I finish college.\"\nIt is easy to change majors at Penn.\n\"2) How is the workload at Penn? Is it really stressful and overwhelming? What would you rate it out of 10?\"\nOn exam weeks, student are pretty stressed. Most of the time, students are also having a good amount of fun. They tend to be engaged socially, as well as in clubs and other activities in addition to classes. The opportunities at Penn are limited by the hours in the day. To manage stress, be careful about getting involved in more opportunities than you can manage.\n\"3) How is the social life in terms of making friends as a Freshman?\"\nMy D has a lot of friends. It helps to participate in the programs that are offered before school begins, and get involved in clubs or groups that interest you early on. It also helps to put yourself out there a bit with other freshman. Everyone is in the same situation.\n4) How was your Freshman transition?\nD had a good transition. It took her a little time to really establish a group of friends but that is true anywhere. I think by the end of the first semester she felt quite established.\nI understand that going to an Ivy, and being away from home are a bit scary. However, if you did not have all the tools to be successful, Penn would not have admitted you. They have many valedictorians and applicants with perfect SAT scores available for every single place in the freshman class. To admit you, one more of those students had to be rejected. Someone was very impressed with your achievements and confident that you would be a success or they would have chosen someone else.\nThe fact that you are a bit nervous about going is a good sign, that just means you are smart and thoughtful. Take up the challenge and meet it head on. You can do it, and you will always be glad you did. Have a great 4 years!

Will I be able to change majors if I wanted to or am I too late? I really want to get into politics and government when I finish college.\nYou declare after like a year or two. You're fine. In fact, you might even want to switch from PoliSci to something else or tack on another major or minor. A lot of people do double majors. Even more do minors. Also don't be afraid to take PoliSci grad classes - it's literally just reading (although harder reading).\n2) How is the workload at Penn? Is it really stressful and overwhelming? What would you rate it out of 10?\n9/10 depending on what you're looking for. If you want straight A's and have taken AP's, etc, you can do 4 classes a semester and graduate. This is a much better route and easier to study for, etc. Classes here can be hard af. However, you can also make it easy. Generally, most people are stressed and overwhelmed 24/7. That said, people still have friends, have fun, party, procrastinate, blah, blah, blah. You need to make an effort to find balance yourself because no one will give it to you.\n3) How is the social life in terms of making friends as a Freshman?\nEveryone latches onto one another in freshman year. I am still friends (close-best friends) with people from my hall. However, it's easy to get stuck with **** people. Also freshman year often sucks. You need to initiate, be almost aggressively friendly, etc. Even then, people here can be unfriendly. Never ask if someone is a freshman. The question is \"what year are you?\"\n4) How was your Freshman transition?\nBad.

Here's a couple of things you can do to help avoid that:\nAs Much2learn mentioned, there are usually some programs that start shortly before school. Look into these and do one (at my school aeons ago I did an Outdoor Club trip). This really helps because you start off with a smaller group of kids and experience something together so it gives you an instant commonality and something to bond over, so when school starts and thousands of kids are there, you already know some kids.\nSome kids might have a hard time transitioning from high school to college academically if their high school programs weren't that strong. I'm thinking of our tour guide at Duke who grew up in farm country and said she didn't have a lot of exposure to things. She said she went to a lot of tutoring sessions and was able to catch up with her classmates by Spring semester. If you think you might fall into this category, you should find out about how tutoring is offered at Penn, and you might want to consider taking a lighter course load your first semester.\nYou might also want to find out information about the counseling center in advance, so if you start experiencing a lot of anxiety while you are there, or if you get into a bad situation while you are there, you know where to go for help and what's involved with getting it. I don't know if the following would be helpful or hurtful to you (depends on your personality), but what about thinking about a potential negative situation and talking with your parents about how you'd handle it? Like, what would you do if your roommate has illegal drugs in the room?\nFinally, others should chime in here, because there have to be a couple of good books that you could read about this issue, and I think having some more knowledge going into this would make you feel more in control and relaxed.

These include income adjusted repayment and pay-as-you-earn. They are tied to your income and basic expenses after graduation, and monthly payment can actually be as little as 0; they are certified each year. Depending on the loan type, they then can be forgiven after 20-25 years of reliable payment, although you then have to pay tax on the forgiven amount. It is a very good deal for those who are lower income and worried about a low salary on graduation.\n$20K debt is not horrible--I look at it as the price of a car, although a far better investment to my mind!\nMy own kids are financially in your boat, and if you were my kid, I'd advise Penn. The opportunities are incredible. The argument about being a big fish in a small pond has some merit, but only for some people in some circumstances; it's also very hard to compare since there's no control (you can't take the same person and put them in a big fish situation and a small fish situation). I agree that statistically though, it's clear that going to Penn opens up more doors and opportunities, particularly to a lower income person.\nThe final thing is that if you take hard-science pre-med classes at a state university, it's not like they're going to be incredibly easier than at Penn; they may in fact be harder to get that A, who knows. Often the hard-science pre-meds are very reliant on the particular professor - the way they teach the class, the curve they use - as opposed to the university.\nBottom line is you just can't beat opportunities plus the calibre of the student body and faculty at Penn (or a similar institution).

Penn's graduate programs have an EA deadline like an undergrad program would that is November 15th. Penn's admissions department themselves claim it is easier to get in if you submit your application by that deadline since you are competing with less applications. Otherwise, you get grouped together with everyone who applied between November and March 15th plus the ones they deferred from the EA group. The November deadline is also great because they give you a decision early which is really helpful when trying to plan out your post-graduation life. You're going to need your GRE done by November 15th in order to have a complete application and be counted in that group.\nAs for research, I can only give you anecdotal evidence but I didn't do any research with a professor as an undergrad when I applied/got accepted to Penn but I did have post-undergrad full time work experience. If you want a thesis-based master's degree, they will want to see research experience. A course-work only masters might let you get away with no research.\nI'd recommend you make the most of any senior design or capstone project your school offers. It serves as both proof of interest in your chosen field and you interact pretty closely with your advising professor which comes in handy when looking for people to write you letters of rec.\nAlso, you are more likely to get responses about grad school on the grad school cc forum. http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/graduate-school/ ", "user_id": "100586776", "user_name": "hisllama ", "user_thread_count": "1", "user_comment_count": "123"}, {"date": {"month": "April", "day": "24,", "year": "2017", "time": "7:35PM"}, "comment": "\nThank you so much.

The old adage is \"they can keep you out, but they can't get you in.\" Having GRE scores that are too low can get your application cut in a first or second-round pass. But having really high GRE scores is unlikely to have a big impact - once you are past a certain threshold the department usually turns to other aspects of your application. And GPA, especially your major GPA, is a better indicator of your knowledge and potential than GRE scores.\n^ from: https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/graduate-school/1868291-the-grad-school-forum-faq-check-here-first.html\nSo provided you don't screw up too much on the GRE, you should be fine.

And as a transfer student, you have at least 1 year or so of academic standings so their focus would be on college grades/gpa and workload. The high school grades are probably looked at and considered but not at a similar level to the college academics.\nECs are probably the next thing that they'll prioritize because as a mature adult (and no longer a teenager), you already had the freedom to explore your interests and find what matters to you. So the ECs should ideally reflect who you are and they should have depth and a purpose (and not just random things together like back in high school). Ideally, I think they expect the ECs to reflect you as a person because as an adult who probably doesn't have as much time as a high school student, surely you would choose what matters to you and not just to look good. So even if you don't have a lot of ECs, the emphasis you put in them (and the work and meaning) is what they look for.\nNext, they probably look at the essays to understand the person in you and your personality and values. The essays provide a \"face\" to the application because they reflect the human side of you and what you will bring as a person to the community and class. I think they look for those letters of recommendation together witth the essays because your college professors could provide more insight of you as a person now that you are an adult (and more in depth aspects of you) in comparison to the LOR from high school teachers who only knew a teenager. That is why it is very important to choose a teacher who knows you well so they can back up your traits and values as a person in accordance to your essays\nAnd finally, I think they look at test scores and high school grades together. Although I personally think that as a transfer student, test scores and high school grades shouldn't be emphasized much because you have already been at college-level classes for a while, so they are more like old news. And why would they put a lot of emphasis on grades from years ago in comparison to recent grades?\nI think they see them just to look at what level you were before and what you are at now. That way they can see if you have expanded yourself academically.

But here in Babson they are not accepting my high school credits and not even full credits of UC Irvine's freshman year as UC Irvine is a quarter system. If I go to Babson, I will approximately start from first year. While my UC Irvine degree with the aid of credits is only 3 years in total, and I am already done with one.\nI really love entrepreneurship, but please suggest is it worth spending 4 more years (total 5 including the one at UCI) and $280K in tution to go to Babson, or to just complete my BA here in UCI as Business Admin. I plan to open up my own business and tha's why Babson was my dream school. But please tell is it worth doing this much?\nMy tution at Babson is 70K per year while 50K per year in UC Irvine as I'm out of state.\nBabson:\n4 more years (graduate in 2020)\npay 280K more (total 330K including UC Irvine's one year tution)\nUC Irvine\n2 more years (graduate in 2018)\npay 100K more (total 150K: 3 years tution)\nPlease guide me is Babson really worth it?

I have taken an extremely rigorous course load: so far, ten AP courses and ten honors courses. I am very interested in economics, and since my high school doesn't offer any economics, I am currently taking a Principles of MMicroeconomics course at my local community college. I am doing extremely well in that class - 100s on every test - so that has led me to attempt to enroll (colleges have dumb cap limits) in an Intermediate Microeconomics course at my local University. Aside from the classroom, I have lettered in a varsity sport all four years of high school, I have been EXTREMELY involved and hold GREAT leadership positions in a business club (for privacy reasons, I am retracting certain information, lol), and I will be attending a highly-selective entrepreneurship program this summer (again, retracting).\nMy weaknesses comes in with grades and rec letters (the two worst possible weaknesses). I have made mostly As in courses, though these As have been either high or low (no middle ground); however, I have made poor grades in calculus (which Wharton takes seriously): a 90 in AB and a B (not finalized, but it will be a  in BC.

I have not been performing so well in her class, and I think she notices the lack of effort, so the letter will probably be weak.\nWhile visiting the campus (twice), I have amassed a LOT of information in preparation for my Why Penn essay and my interview.

Though if literally anyone has evidence of that, I'd love to see it. And no, the stories about how recruiting works that have been shared here are *not* accurate at all. First of all, no coach would ever tell a recruit how many slots they have per school, and if they do then they're playing you, because they don't know how many slots they have per school! Admissions doesn't say to baseball, \"well you can have 2 Whartonites this year but you can have 13 SEAS slots.\" The schools to which athletes matriculate within Penn are largely decided by their own interests. And no, the Wharton recruits are decidedly not more qualified than the recruits to Penn's other undergrad programs. But again, if anyone has evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it.\nBasically, talk to the recruiting coach and let them know you're interested. He'll probably say, \"which school,\" and you'll answer \"wharton,\" and then if you are a good fit for Penn and his team, he'll make it work. Athletes are nearly guaranteed their spot in their chosen undergrad program once they've confirmed with Athletics that their being officially recruited and they apply ED (at that point, your academic credentials don't matter beyond the fact that you were generally qualified to attend Penn without messing up their Academic Index- it's not about being qualified for a specific program so much as it is being qualified to be an Ivy Athlete- a highly regulated status). Hiccups do happen, of course, but it's not terribly common. I can imagine it happening if you really mess up senior year and no longer meet the qualifications set out by the Academic Index or you make a terrible impression in another way. But otherwise, yes, if you say you want Wharton, you'll get Wharton.\nAnd finally, coaches don't prefer kids from the College. Granted, engineers and pre-med kids in the college tend to have more time-intensive class schedules and that can be a pain to coordinate so they don't love it from an administrative standpoint-- but Whartonites have ABSOLUTELY no trouble being on sports teams and coaches know they don't have schedules that differ in any way from the vast majority of students in the other undergrad programs in a meaningful way.

Wharton does have fewer total undergrads than the College and so there tend to be fewer athletes as an absolute number in Wharton than in the College. That being said, seats are not apportioned for athletes from admissions by each undergrad school and there aren't differing standards for each undergrad program. Furthermore, Penn, like the other ivies, is composed of about 13% recruited athletes and the choices about which program they choose are almost always (I won't say always because I cannot say that with certainty- but it could be always) the products of the athlete's academic interest alone. Penn admissions and Penn athletics are not, at least at an institutional level, telling kids \"well you meet the criteria for the academic index but you should apply to the College because we have more room there than in Wharton.\" That's just not how the process works. Finally, the difference between the acceptance rates of the College and Wharton are about 1 to 2 percentage points- not enough of a disparity for a coach to advise someone to apply through the College if their interests reside in Wharton anyway. In essence, there isn't 'more room' in the College, despite being larger, because competition for those seats is equally as fierce.

It is also important to consider how poli sci and econ will intersect if you're truly interested in both, and Penn is making moves to integrate them in a way that Georgetown is not. With Penn's new Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics, both departments will be housed in one, absolutely gorgeous building that is going to allow for collaboration in the most state of the art poli sci/econ facilities available in higher education today.\n\"The Perelman Center will be home to two of the School\u2019s largest departments, along with five centers with a global and/or public policy focus. It will become a hub for the social sciences that will foster intellectual interaction and collaboration across disciplines, and will bring interdisciplinary scholarly expertise to bear on contemporary issues and events, at home and around the world.\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/foundations-and-frontiers/foundations/education/ronald-o-perelman-center-political-science-and-economicshttps://www.sas.upenn.edu/supporting-sas/giving-priorities/our-campus/ronald-o-perelman-center-political-science-and-economicshttps://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-receives-25-million-gift-create-perelman-center-political-science-and-economics\nIt is hard to express just how profound this will be for the two departments and undergraduate education in the social sciences in general. Furthermore, Penn's new Perry World Forum is also a major investment in political science and public policy that has been bringing the brightest minds in international relations to Penn's campus with unprecedented frequency, all while substantively engaging the undergraduate community in new and innovative ways.https://penncurrent.upenn.edu/news/former-un-ambassador-samantha-power-to-keynote-perry-world-house-conferencehttps://news.upenn.edu/news/distinguished-panel-penn-s-perry-world-house-addresses-national-security-electionhttp://www.thedp.com/article/2017/03/perry-world-house-bonnie-jenkins-tarun-chhabra-nell-crockerhttps://news.upenn.edu/news/penns-perry-world-house-launches-inaugural-visitors-programhttps://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-s-perry-world-house-announces-inaugural-undergraduate-fellowshttps://www.lawfareblog.com/what-are-implications-emerging-technologies-ai-driven-robotics-and-automation-globalization\nHonestly, the edge I once would have given to Georgetown and Columbia in terms of bringing fantastic, politically oriented speakers to campus 5 or 6 years ago, I no longer believe exists. Penn has invested so much in making its home in Philadelphia a center for global and domestic politics that I no longer see a difference between those three fantastic schools on that front. And let's not forget that Joe Biden is just chilling on campus these days leading the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.http://www.upenn.edu/spotlights/vice-president-joe-biden-lead-penn-biden-center-diplomacy-and-global-engagement\nHe's also actually now a professor at Penn and he has spoke at Penn 2 times within a two month period already: http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/03/joe-biden-discussion-march-30\nNeedless to say, your desires to engage with local, state-wide, national, and international politics will be ably satisfied by Penn. And I won't even get started on the strength of Penn's economics department and the added value of having one of the best business and law schools right on campus. I mean, I can if you want me too! Just ask  -- but i think i'll leave it there for now.\nYou'll also have absolutely no trouble landing an incredible internship in DC during the summer if you want it (or, I believe you can do a semester in DC). I happily worked for the Federal Government in one of the executive departments (State, Treasury, Justice, Defense, etc. etc. etc.) and i had several friends at other executive departments, in the White House, on the Hill, in nonprofits, at think tanks, and more. Penn is VERY well represented in DC. Having an internship during the school year won't really help more with law school apps than having one during the summer, but there are plenty of great opportunities in philly as well if you're interested. You can do work with one of Penn's centers (Fel's Institute of Government, Fact Check, anything at Penn law) and there are a bunch of think tanks and nonprofits in philly of which you can take advantage. Genuinely, you won't have trouble putting together a great application to law school. In fact, the top 5 law schools at which students from penn matriculated last year were: Penn, NYU, Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/20152016lawstats -- and those are only the students that actually decided to enroll-- many more students are accepted to those law schools from penn undergrad each year than are represented on that chart.\nGenerally, I don't think you can go wrong with these two schools. They're both fantastic and are strikingly similar in the ways that i think matter most in a university. That being said, Penn is the better choice in my opinion. I'm happy to answer any other questions you might have-- just let me know! good luck  ", "user_id": "568566", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}]}, {"topic": "Biomedical Engineering and Business Double Major - Penn", "url": "https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-pennsylvania/1984053-biomedical-engineering-and-business-double-major-penn.html", "comments": [{"date": {"month": "April", "day": "16,", "year": "2017", "time": "6:04PM"}, "comment": "\nHello:\nI am a high school who is thinking of applying to the University of Pennsylvania for a double major in BME and Business.

Students pick the dorm and room type that they want (for example, Ware \u2013 single or Riepe \u2013 double). Students number their preferences 1-6 and we receive our dorm assignments on June 9th.\nDorm Specifics\nThe Quad (Fisher-Hassenfeld, Ware, and Riepe) \u2013 all freshman\nThis is where the majority of freshman will live \u2013 it\u2019s known for having a very social atmosphere and is a great opportunity for freshmen to get to know each other. I\u2019ve been told that room size varies widely depending on the room, but they are a decent size overall (the Quad has doubles/singles, community style bathrooms). Also, located down the street from Wawa for late night snack runs. I believe that most people who live in the Quad eat at Commons \u2013 I could be wrong.\n*I\u2019ve been told that rats and cockroaches are a problem in the Quad, but I don\u2019t know if this is accurate (some current Penn students might be able to confirm/deny this). In fact, at the information session for housing when the director of housing asked the audience if we had heard any rumors about housing at Penn someone screamed \u201cRATS\u201d and a few seconds later someone else yelled \u201cROACHES\u201d and the housing director was stunned.\nHill \u2013 all freshman\nWas closed this previous year for renovation, but will be re-opening in the fall should it should be really nice. Hill has singles and doubles in addition to having semi-private/hybrid style bathrooms (individual rooms with either a shower/toilet that only one person can use at a time). Has a dining facility. Also, known for having a strong community feel.\nNew College House \u2013 will be a four-year college house in 2017-18 (was all freshman this year)\nSuite style dorm (2-6 people per suite, each with their own room and they share a bathroom). Has a dining facility.\nGregory & Stouffer \u2013 four-year college houses\nI don\u2019t know very much about these two. Gregory is suite style and is pretty tight knit \u2013 they go on trips as a house pretty frequently I hear. Stouffer has a good number of singles if that is desired.\nKings Court English \u2013 all freshman\nSingles & Doubles, community style bathrooms. Has a dining facility.\nDu Bois \u2013 four-year college house\nSuite style (some rooms have living rooms & kitchens)\nDining\nI\u2019ve heard that the food at Penn is decent and that there are always lot of options for students to choose from. They also mentioned that they can accommodate allergies, vegan diets, vegetarian diets, etc.\nThe most common dining plan for freshman is the Best Food Fit (BFF) Plan that gives students 125 swipes per semester with $500 dining dollars. The other two plans are the AFK Plan with 250 swipes per semester and $100 dining dollars (popular among athletes) and the BEN Plan with 170 swipes per semester and $225 dining dollars.\nClass Registration\nThis is directly from Penn\u2019s website\n\u201cPrior to Advance Registration, incoming freshmen must have a discussion with their pre-major advisor about their academic interests and goals, and to plan a schedule for their first semester. After being removed from registration hold by their advisor, students may enter Advance Registration course requests using Penn InTouch. Penn InTouch requires a student to log on using their PennKey and password.\u201d\nPenn also has more advice on how to register for classes and create a schedule on the Courses and Registration section of their website.\nI\u2019m not in Wharton so I don\u2019t know if their course registration policies differ.\nIf you have any more questions regarding Penn or what happened at ConnectED Quaker Day feel free to post them here or PM me.

Someone first shouted \"roaches\" and people sort of laughed. Then actually I shouted (hopefully not screamed!) \"Mice\" - not rats - because a friend's son had indeed had a bad mouse infestation. I didn't think the housing director was stunned--my reading was that he sort of just tried to move on. I do wish he'd addressed it, to be honest, although understandably he was no doubt taken off guard. All large buildings can have roach and mice problems (rats are an entirely different issue and no one was talking about rats to my knowledge) but I was genuinely curious how big a problem it was and what Penn did about it.\nThat was my only slightly negative experience--everything else was extremely positive. My S has already selected his room; it was very easy. Be sure to get your choices in by May 1; after that they said the choices diminish quite a bit. They discussed the food choices too--there are three choices, and they are all the same price. As @violinvirtuoso3 says, they are basically combinations of how much dining dollars you have embedded in. They said the most dining dollars was the most popular, but one of the student speakers said he liked the least dining dollars, as he was a big eater and really preferred the amount of food offered in regular dining. If you don't choose anything, then they will select the most popular for you.\nFor dorm, if you don't have a roommate, they will match; you can also have the choice of 'gender neutral'. They stressed to remember that gender neutral meant just that, and you could be paired with any gender.

It was a good essay that I thoroughly loved and thought was my best one. I changed a good chunk of it, applied to specifically UPenn and gave that. I am not going to rate my essays since they will be pretty biased and I would overrank them.\nCommon App Essay: It was a bit of risk, but I love it. It talked about my experience with interning at the local legislative and how none of them cared. At the end, we got to offer a fake bill and mine was sexual comprehensive bill, which I got a negative feedback. People telling me I liked sex or people insulting me. I live in a very conservative state. It hurt a lot since I put a lot of passion and preparation for a speech.

I am surreal to find out that I got accepted. Everything feels like a dream. I have really nothing going for me. I think my essays really pushed for me because they contained a lot of emotion and heart. Honestly, my test scores were alright and being Asian that definitely can work against me. This feels great since I basically got rejected from all of other reaches. Emory stung the most.

I just want you to know that you don't have to be perfect to go to a school like this. They are not looking for perfect stats. They are truly looking for it and whether you can contribute to the overall culture of the campus. These processes are truly holistic because I am honestly an average student with nothing truly special. Those who were rejected, the school doesn't make you, you make the school. Don't let this rejection define you. Those who were accepted, congrats! Go Quakers!

I used to look through all the Penn results thread (starting Soph year) because it was my #1, so I'm doing this to help future applicants. My #1 advice is apply to a good range of schools, and write KILLER essays. These essays should desplay passion, creativity, and curiosity (among other things). Use descriptive language, make sure the adcoms remember you! Don't be afraid to shoot for the sky!! I didn't think I'd get into any selective colleges, but that has not been the case at all. But also LOVE your \"safety\". I absolutely love my safety (my state school), and I'm still considering it because they gave me a full ride.\nNow I'm left with so many choices that it is hard to choose, but feeling so blessed and lucky!

Make sure your essays tell a story, are not boring, and reinforce the theme/spike to your application, because that's what makes them stand out.\nWhy UPenn (9/10) - talked about getting excited about interdisciplinary ideas at my dinner table, showed how different programs/departments/overall opportunities at UPenn make the school another dinner table. Talked about non-academic pursuits at UPenn as well, how one of my goals is to \"cultivate an interest in muenster cheese and focaccia bread\" at some notorious food trucks there haha.

Also my essays were very strong, make sure to tell a story that supports your spike/theme in a quirky way.\nWeaknesses: LOL grades and AP scores in general. I got a C in AP Physics (hate that class) on my midyear report first trimester of senior year, so I was REALLY worried that would tank me completely. The C was due to family circumstances (heart arrhythmia with my dad, I actually tied the explanation to my extracurriculars/passion quite nicely, really lessened the blow of a crappy midyear report, got counselor to support it in an additional update).

I just got lucky. Plain and simple, don't read too much into your decisions because it can seemingly be random at times and they do not determine your worth as a person.\nGeneral Comments: I didn't care at all about school in my freshman year, so my GPA took a beating. I started to wake up and realize that I didn't want to go to my state school (no offense ASU!) and end up with a desk job, working 9 to 5 and not accomplishing more. I was entitled - I thought I was such a smart kid, and that I was destined to rule the world, cure cancer, marry Emma Watson. So I involved myself in a bunch of clubs that I didn't care about, started studying for tests that I hated studying for, all in an attempt to pad my application. In my senior year, I took a look at myself and I didn't know who I was. I was a phony, a hack, who did what he had to do to get to a place that he thought he had to get to. I embraced my quirks and my love for music during this past year, but I regret that it was too late. When I look back on my high school life, I realize that I wasted my time doing things that I didn't like doing. I can't think of more than 5 memorable experiences I had in my high school years. I just wish I had accepted myself earlier. Then I could say, \"Oh I don't regret high school. I had a ton of fun!\"\nAnyways, remember that admissions to top colleges are basically like drawing the lottery. I'm blessed to be accepted to these institutions. I just feel weird, knowing that they didn't accept me, per se - they accepted a bluffed-up version of me.\nOther College Decisions: Harvard (Accepted), Princeton (Accepted), Amherst (Accepted), Wesleyan (Accepted), USC (Accepted), Vanderbilt (Accepted), UChicago (WL), Dartmouth (WL), Northwestern (WL), Pomona (WL), University of Virginia (WL), MIT (Rejected), Columbia ED (Rejected), Brown (Rejected), Yale (Rejected), UPenn (Rejected) ", "user_id": "100428612", "user_name": "daboombas ", "user_thread_count": "19", "user_comment_count": "53"}, {"date": {"month": "April", "day": "1,", "year": "2017", "time": "11:23AM"}, "comment": "\nREJECTED!!\nObjective:\nSAT I (breakdown): 1550 (750 eng, 800 math)\nACT (breakdown): 35 (35 eng, 35 math, 34 reading, 36 science)\nSAT II: Math 2 (800), Chinese (780)\nUnweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.97\nRank (percentile if rank is unavailable): probably around top 15/500\nAP (place score in parenthesis): Biology, Psychology, Chem, US History, English, Chinese (all 4s/5s)\nSenior Year Course Load: AP Gov, AP Calc AB, AP Physics 1, AP Compsci A, English, Band\nMajor Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): None\nSubjective:\nExtracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Marching band, various music ensembles, cultural club\nJob/Work Experience: No \"official\" job\nVolunteer/Community service: Lots of tutoring/teaching\nSummer Activities: did berkeley summer session before\nEssays (rating 1-10, details): I'd say a 6, i didn't have anyone read them for me because they were really personal\nRecommendations (rating 1-10, details): one of them a 9, another one probably at 6. counselor rec like 6 bc my school is really big and our counselors don't really know us personally\nOther\nApplied for Financial Aid?: yes\nIntended Major: politic\nState (if domestic applicant): California\nCountry (if international applicant): USA\nSchool Type: Public\nEthnicity: Asian\nGender: Female\nIncome Bracket: Pretty high\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None\nReflection\nStrengths: My test scores, basically\nWeaknesses: my extracurriculars are really not on the same level as most ivy applicants\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: what i said above\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted at UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSB, UCSD, UCD, UCI, USC, Boston university.

When y'all are writing your applications, make sure you think about what your identity you want to portray and then make sure every single part of your app bolsters that image.

In hindsight, college apps are so random - I was 100% sure that if I was going to go to any ivy it would be Brown (because of fit/my interview went spectacularly) and I though Penn would reject me no doubt, but it turned out to be the opposite. It goes to show that legitimately there is no rhyme or rhythm or pattern of any kind to admissions and if you just focus on your passions throughout highschool/in your app some college will see something in you that they'd like in their freshman class.

I am also a legacy (dad went to Penn) that is interested in pursuing business - however, I do not want to apply EA next year to UPenn or Wharton School at UPenn, Although I recognize that UPenn's business program is top in the world, Penn is not my top choice due to other reasons (very good personal reasons, although I will not list them here). Therefore, I have decided not to apply EA to Penn due to the fact that it is restrictive EA and I want to potentially apply to see if I could get in EA to the other school of my choice. However, I realize that acceptance to the other school is potentially unlikely, and would like to apply to UPenn in regular decision rounds with the rest of my college applications.\nHow would UPenn look on this decision, particularly because of legacy status? I have heard that it is not good to be a legacy (especially one pursuing business), that does not apply EA to UPenn and Wharton in EA, but instead to another university, and then applying in regular round. I would be happy with going to UPenn, but personal reasons make this choice not preferable.\nWould it be better to just not apply EA to anything and apply regular rounds to all my colleges?\nThanks for the feedback - would like to know before I potentially screw up my future somehow.

In the midwest, NU is viewed very prestigiously.\nBut for location: I do agree that Penn's location and NU's location are somewhat similar as far as city-ish feel. Chicago is the bigger city, but NU is not in Chicago; it doesn't feel like it's in Chicago; it's on a gorgeous lake in Evanston, a suburb. True, you can get to Chicago by train or by cab/uber--how frequently will depend on how much you want to go into the city and your own schedule. The physical site of NU's campus is stunning - the lake is so gorgeous - although for pure stunningness I personally think Cornell is the most stunning.

Philly has many, many areas and many different places to explore. Penn is not quite in the area of most interests in Philly, but it's still in Philly as opposed to Evanston; and you can easily walk to places of interest, eg the art museum.

My S got in with a generous package, similar to my older D's package at Northwestern though she'd applied RD.\nBefore my S, I heeded the advice to apply RD if we needed financial aid. I realize now that was good and bad advice. It's good advice if you are middle-need and/or more complex need, and want to apply for merit-need or merit scholarships; these can be negotiated. Merit-need is a looser concept, based on a more holistic assessment of the need and how much the college wants you; it can be open to negotiation and other offers.\nBut not applying ED if you need financial aid is bad advice if you are, like me, a straightforward financial aid candidate with straightforward Profile and FAFSA (no investments, complex situations etc). Ivy league financial aid for straightforward high need is done by formula. This formula is relatively the same ED as RD.\nThere are compelling reasons to go ED; you have a higher chance of getting in, you have peace of mind, etc.\nIn our case financial aid was strong; I know this by comparing my other kids' offers at Northwestern and Williams.\nAs others point out, if you apply ED and the offer is not good enough, they are open to negotiation but this will typically not amount to more than a few thousand dollars unless there is some mistake or new data. However, you are allowed to back out. This would cancel your offer of admission-- but remember you could simply apply to other schools--there is still plenty of time to do that if you are already prepared.

You get great students, they commit early, yield is super-high, and you can use RD to fill in the gaps.\nBut here's the problem: when do you have too much of a good thing? Penn used to fill maybe 1/3 of the class ED, and that number has crept up over the past 15-20 years. During this time, schools have fought hard to look more similar to one another than ever before. Institutionally, for example, Northwestern has never been so similar to Penn as now, and Penn has never looked so similar to, say, Harvard. ED, though, is ruthless: pick your true love out of many similar-looking suitors now, or forever hold your peace.\nThis year, with Penn on track to fill 55% of its class ED, it looks like there are two application options:\nApply on time (ED), or apply late (RD).\nIn recent years, the applicant pool has noted this signal, and ED apps continue to spike at College Hall.

In the past few years, Columbia, Duke, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, etc. all have increased their use of ED. Further, Chicago, one of the last principled holdouts, allegedly went completely off the deep end and followed ED to its logical conclusion: a class that is overwhelmingly filled ED.\nGiven all of this, as the data/literature and stats about the ED pool has NOT changed over the past 15-20 years, I think it'd be great if Penn (the heaviest user of this, until Chicago's numbers can be confirmed) started to dial it back.

Few, if any schools will follow I think. ED is too convenient for an institution to just abandon it or dramatically reduce it. Yes Penn was the first one to do it, but honestly it was a matter of time until a non-HYPSM elite school thought of this in their quest for to grow in prominence and appear more selective/desirable.

Some things to consider\n1. Penn provides an ivy league education to more students from a lower socioeconomic background than all of the other Ivies except for Cornell. While the percentage of students who have access to this education is important, the absolute number is actually what matters most when considering societal impact. While Penn may not have huge percentages of students from the lowest socioeconomic rungs of the ladder, it is still providing an incredible education to more students from that income bracket than its peers, giving it a larger overall impact on society. It also does so with fewer resources per student available than Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth. Yet it often has larger percentages of students from the lowest income brackets than all of those schools except for Harvard as well-- meaning they are educating more disadvantaged as a percentage of their class and in absolute numbers. So perhaps its use of early decision is actually an engine for socioeconomic diversity and at the very least, there is no evidence that other schools of equal quality with SCEA (or early action) are doing much better with regard to socioeconomic diversity despite not having ED. In fact, among the Ivy + group, Columbia (Dean Furda's old stomping grounds) is considered the most socioeconomically diverse and it also has a robust ED program. Maybe in order to improve access to these universities, more schools should make the switch to ED?\n2. Penn gets enough ED applicants to fills its class nearly 3 times. It is in a position unique from all of its peers in that it gets so many more ED applicants (as an absolute number and as a percentage of the class they intend to enroll). Thus, Penn actually shows great restraint in only filling about half its class with ED when ED candidates are usually more qualified academically, more capable of paying full tuition, and they've indicated that Penn is their unrivaled first choice. Judging Penn by the standards of other universities that aren't in particularly equivalent positions isn't going to yield a particularly nuanced assessment of the value of ED for Penn.\n3. I love the dedication to Penn that its use of ED creates. I was an RD admit who chose Penn partially because there was a spirit on campus that screamed \"I LOVE IT HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE.\" I did not feel that spirit at Columbia. I did not feel that spirit at Princeton, or Brown and I definitely never felt it at Cornell. But Penn had that feeling on campus that every student genuinely wanted to be there. Part of that is because such a huge proportion of the students chose to bind themselves to the school because they were so sure that it was the right place for them. If Penn were going to lose some of that character without ED then it would be a loss that transferring to SCEA or EA wouldn't be worth. Because it doesn't change the quality of the education-- Penn would still be providing what I consider to be a superior undergraduate education. But it would change the vibe on campus without improving socioeconomic diversity or somehow improving the school overall-- no thanks.\n4. Penn is not Harvard.. or yale... and it definitely ain't Princeton- and Quakers LOVE THAT! Harvard is allowed to do what ever it wants in college admissions. It had ED, it had EA, it had SCEA, it had no early program. It does as it pleases and it largely defines what other universities can safely do without criticism. But Penn doesn't have to follow along. It is its own institution with its own unique needs. Penn shouldn't bend to the pressures of its peers just to play by their rules. Penn threw out the rules book, blazed its own trail and it led to wild success for the University. Why turn back now? So that it can enroll as few students from the lowest incomes brackets as Princeton and Yale? Penn has 4 undergrad schools and provides a great education to more students than both Princeton and Yale. If it believes its admissions programs would benefit more from a different model than the one Princeton and Yale use, then so be it! Nobody is talking about how Princeton should open up a nursing school because of the incomparable good it provides to a nation with a severe shortage of nurses. Princeton feels it best educates its students without one and benefits the most disadvantaged in our nation despite not graduating any nurses. Fine! But if the way Penn chooses to fill its class is different than its peers, perhaps its because Penn is a wildly different school. And thank goodness for that.

I knew that because of Penn's huge financial aid budget, money would not be an issue; and worst case scenario I could just break my binding agreement citing financial difficulty.\nAll of my friends are currently in the process of deciding which school they want to attend out of their more than a handful of acceptances - what a great problem to have! Sometimes I get envious and wonder what the result of my other college decisions would have been; then I remember how much time, money, and effort I saved having only applied to four colleges out of the ten I originally planned to apply to.\nAlso, I really don't believe the lack of representation of low-income students is primarily a college's fault. Selective schools are looking for a profile that the majority of low-income students do not meet. Everyone can agree that education is the primary way one can climb the social ladder, however, does one need to go to an ivy plus school to do this? No.\nWhat matters most is the mindset and culture that a student has grown up in. I've noticed a common trend in my time of lurking on CC and attending Penn Quaker Day. While the majority of black Americans are low-income, the majority of low-income students at elite schools are not black, not even Hispanic, but Asian. The blacks and Hispanics who make it into these institutions are for the most part, not first-gen and at the very least middle class.\nI'll preface this by saying, yes I am black - but in this context, I am \"black.\"\nI am the child of Ethiopian immigrants who while never being uber strict taught me to prioritize education above all else. They taught me not to treat education as a necessity but a privilege. This is missing from most black households who teach their children to endure education rather than revel in it.\nAre you guys saying that ED is not an option for low-income students because they would not be able to bet on being able to afford to attend - or is it that they don't have the knowledge of how ED admissions work?\nP.S. sorry if I drove this thread in a direction it didn't need to go in but I think this is an interesting conversation to have.

In terms of actual departmental strength in biochem/biology/chemical engineering/bionengineering there are not any real differences, esp at the undergrad level. One thing in favor of Penn is that it has one of the best medical schools and hospitals right on campus and there are many research opportunities offered through them which are available to undergrads.\nIn terms of overall funding/resources Penn is a richer school than Cornell and Williams on a total endowment basis. On a per student basis Willliams is the richest (much fewer students), followed by Penn and then Cornel. However Williams, being a LAC, does not have the research capabilities, grad schools, prominent faculty of a top research university.\n2. Penn has a very flexible curriculum and it is rather easy to change majors, double major etc. Penn is known for its focus on interdisciplinary education and it very much encourages that amongst its students. As an undergrad at Penn you can take classes in almost any undergrad and grad school of the university and the variety of classes offered is huge.\n3. All three schools are very rigorous. Don't think that because Williams is a LAC it is going to be more chill. In terms of grade deflation, Cornell and Williams are a bit tougher than Penn (tougher to get a high GPA), but Penn has no easy grading either, you will have to work very hard.\n4. Greek life is prominent at both Penn and Cornell. I can speak for Penn specifically. While Greek life is prominent is far from dominant, most people are not part of frats and their social life does not revolve around frats. Being practically in the city there so many things to do. At the same time Penn has a distinct campus so you get both the offerings of the city and a cohesive famous atmosphere.\nI feel you should think about fit quite a bit. Williams is a LAC while the other two are major research universities. What kind of environment do you want for you college experience?\nFor the Penn vs Cornell choice, most people choose Penn, but again fit plays a major role in this decision as well.

The most popular majors at a school. STEM majors, especially probably CS and Engineering majors, require a ton of work. And the more the work, and the tighter your personal schedule, (for most people...) the greater the stress. So I imagine schools with a high percentage of STEM majors may have higher overall stress levels.\n2. The overall academic vibe of a school can affect stress: higher rigor means more stress, while less rigor means less stress.\n3. Competition level among students. The higher the level of competition among students -- versus collaboration -- the higher the level of stress.\n4. Social/party scene -- the more developed a school's social/party scene, the more outlets a student has to vent steam... to \"de-stress\".\nRegarding Penn, I don't see a ton of STEM majors relative to other schools -- more than some, less than others.\nI'm not really sure about rigor, but when people make lists of the most rigorous schools, you usually hear names like Chicago, Swat, Reed, Columbia, Cornell, MIT; not usually Penn.\nMost people say that Penn's is a collaborative environment.\nAnd Penn's social reputation is well established.\nSo overall, Penn's overall stress level is probably less than at many, if not most, schools.\nIn the Ivy League, I would think stress levels are highest at Cornell and Columbia, lowest at Penn/Brown/Dartmouth, and HYP are in the middle.

Prospective Penn student here, with a few questions regarding the LSM program and Penn as a whole.\nThe first question is regarding my chances. Clearly no one can predict if I will get into a program as selective as LSM (or even Penn in general), but I was wondering if one factor might skew my chances. I took the ACT in December and received a composite of 34 (36 E, 34 M, 33 R, 36 S, W 11). I am taking the ACT again this weekend, but am worried that if I do not score higher than a 34 this may hurt my chances for such a selective program like LSM. I am hoping to at least raise my scores in math and reading because Penn superscores, but if this does not happen, I was wondering if it may hurt me in the long run. For any LSM students or people who know LSM students on CC: is every student in LSM someone who had a perfect academic track record in high school? Or is it based more on fit for the program?\nBesides the ACT score, I feel my GPA and extra-curriculars are sufficient. I don't really feel the need to get too specific, but my GPA is ~97 unweighted and ~105 weighted (we do not find out ranks until senior year at my school, but I am hoping to be in the top 1% out of a class of 750). My in-school activities are pretty typical: several leadership positions in clubs, varsity sport, student government, etc. My out of school activities are kind of unique; last year I did an independent research project that involved shadowing at the FDA and was selected as a finalist in the MIT Inspire research competition (placed 2nd in my category). Over the summer I had an internship at a research lab at Harvard involving the NASA Twins Study, and won a regional award for the research. I am now currently in the process of starting an NGO with the contacts I made through my research project last year that focuses on access to cancer care in developing countries. This is kind of irrelevant, I just thought I would give everyone a little background on my interests/research.\nAnyway, for any LSM students out there: How do you like the program? Is it stressful/an insane workload? Are you able to manage the work and a social life? How is the guidance/opportunities through the program?\nI'd also love to hear about how anyone else's experiences were/are at Penn. I hear the environment is pretty competitive, but I doubt it is too cutthroat. Does the campus feel purely urban? Or can one still get the sense of a traditional college experience at Penn?\nSorry for this super long post, but thanks for getting this far! Any comments are greatly appreciated.

Also you have good ECs. Scoring higher on the ACT will help for sure but you are already within the feasible range for admission. To answer your question about scores vs fit for LSM, both are important. I knew many LSM kids during my time at Penn who had absolutely perfect SAT scores and GPAs and were absolutely brilliant. In fact that smartest people i met at Penn were LSM. On the other hand I also knew LSM kids with less than perfect (but still great) scores. LSM looks for extremely accomplished students with a clear interest in life sciences and business. So yes fit matters a lot but you need to be a top notch applicant to have a chance.\nAbout Penn in general, it is competitive but not cutthroat. People misunderstand the meaning of competitiveness as it applies to Penn. Penn people are competitive with themselves not against each other. They grind hard, juggle many different things and are very driven. However they are not competitive or mean against other people, they in fact are quite collaborative and helpful towards one another. The reputation for being competitive stems from the fact that most people push themselves to achieve a lot and do a lot of things well so there is some peer pressure to push yourself. But there is a lot of collaboration happening for classes and interview prep for jobs and people are willing to help out.\nRegarding the campus: While Penn is located within walking distance of the Philly center, it is not right in the middle of the city and it has a well defined campus. There is definitely a strong campus feel and community (often referred to as the Penn Bubble). So you kind of get the best of both worlds.
