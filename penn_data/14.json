I know the list isn't a reason for hope, but I've heard from countless mentors that a letter of continued interest and constant communication with the admissions can help me out in the instance that they do decide to chose from the waitlist.\nI have a draft written out expression Penn as my ride or die, though much more business professional, and my willingness to attend 100% if chosen even without consideration of my financial aid package arriving. I was wondering if it would be worth writing some personal connection/reasoning for attending the school or leaving it out since that's already in my app.\nWhen sending the letter out, should I just email the general admissions office at: [email\u00a0protected], should I send them a call after a few days, and should I also send an email to my regional officer? If I found my officer on linkedin/facebook, would it be impressionable in a positive or negative way to send him an inmail through linkedin (if I have a few qualifications and recommendations on it that are pretty good)?\nY'all have been really good to me so thanks a lot for any input!

I opened my decision fully expecting to be rejected but I was surprised in a good way! I also got an amazing financial aid package, making Penn the cheapest out of all my options by a wide margin. So, I am definitely going to Penn.\nI'm very excited and grateful for this opportunity so please don't take this post to mean that I'm somehow not appreciative of my acceptance. Penn is an amazing school and I know that I'll have so many opportunities to learn and grow there over the next four years.\nBut after doing some more research over the past couple days, I'm starting to get a little worried that Penn's overall campus culture might not be the best fit for me. I applied to Penn because I really love their focus on interdisciplinary learning and civic engagement, and I can't wait to take advantage of those two things this fall. But I've also read a lot about how there's a pretty competitive atmosphere on campus, and how most students seem to be on a never ending hamster wheel of sorts, constantly stressed, over-scheduled, and worried about the future rather than enjoying the present.\nThat was pretty much how high school was for me, and it had a bad effect on my mental/emotional health in my junior and senior years. I definitely want to work hard and grow both as a student and person in college but I was hoping to have a more collaborative and relaxed (not the best word to describe what I mean, but basically I don't want to be extremely stressed every single day for the next four years) experience in college. Basically, my question is, do you think I'll still be able to find these things and make Penn work for me? I will be going to Penn for sure mainly due to financial reasons, so I'd love to hear any positive/optimistic responses you guys may have  ", "user_id": "100533015", "user_name": "bssurly ", "user_thread_count": "12", "user_comment_count": "219"}, {"date": {"month": "April", "day": "1,", "year": "2017", "time": "9:50AM"}, "comment": "\nCongratulations! Sounds wonderful that you got in, and it is also your most affordable option. That's really awesome! I understand your fear of being overworked after a grueling high school experience. My daughter felt the same way when deciding on a university. In fact, she could have gone to Ga Tech with a full tuition scholarship, but she read too much about students being up all night doing homework to where she would tremble and break into tears at the thought of going there. She also struggled her junior and senior years of high school with a breakdown of sorts while completing 15 AP courses with a 4.0 unweighted average and all that goes with it. You do not seem apprehensive to the same extent she was. You seem happy about going to U Penn and slightly concerned. I think you will do fine there if you plan on taking care of yourself from the start.\nGet plenty of sleep. Aim for good enough with your coursework rather than being the best in each class. Choose your major and activities with a view toward what you can actually handle without getting too stressed. Just because some people around you might be overdoing it doesn't mean you have to. My daughter is a sophomore at another university right now and still pacing herself with how much effort she puts into her classes. She is not making the high As in every class like she did in high school. At the same time, she doesn't want to have the same breakdown and misery that working so hard brought on either. And she still works plenty hard -- with jobs in two labs and involvement in a couple of clubs and a leadership role. But she sleeps at night, goofs off some in the evenings and weekends, and tries to keep her stress under control.\nI think your self-awareness will allow you to manage your stress levels maturely while attending U Penn. The university will have plenty of resources to get help if needed (academically or emotionally or just advice in general). Some majors will be more competitive than others and involve more late nights, so if you find that your choice of major is too grueling, then look for a different one that still lets you achieve your long-term objectives. You have probably discovered your own best ways of de-stressing by now, whether that is reading, surfing online, working out, or socializing. Be sure and make time for your key de-stress activities, and you will be fine.

I genuinely think Penn is the most incredible place for those interested in a truly interdisciplinary undergraduate education. That being said, Penn (like all of its peers) will provide you with challenging, intellectually rigorous coursework and an array of extracurricular activities that will keep you busier than you thought possible. The key to managing these opportunities and the stress intrinsic to these incredible experiences is practicing self care. There are a few non-negotiables in life: 1) you need 6-9 hours of sleep per night (every night- not 3 hours one night and 12 the next). 2) You need a healthy and balanced diet. 3) You need exercise in some form (I don't care if its chair-yoga, walking to the grocery store, or marathon running-- moving is essential). 4) socializing with friends and keeping in contact with loved ones. If you keep in mind that those 4 parts of your life must ALWAYS come before school work and extracurriculars, you will be more than capable of managing the challenges you face in your college career. College students (understandably) have a lot of trouble remembering to maintain a sense of balance in their lives and consequently they take on more than might be ultimately healthy for them. Your job is to resist the pull of biting off more than you can comfortably chew while making time for the things you really do want to do! And honestly, it's very, very doable!\nFrom personal experience, the VAST majority of Penn students do not feel overworked, hyper-stressed, constantly forward looking, etc. etc. etc. There is an intense vibe on campus but the students feeling the most pressure are often not participating in the various forms of self care that are preconditions to genuine success in school and afterwards. You seem like a smart and self-reflective student who will be more than ready to take stock of their personal needs while maintaining a commitment to your classes and clubs. So what I guess I'm trying to say is, don't worry! If you're the type of student who is already taking into account how to manage the stress they might experience, you are going to be the student most prepared to address that stress when you do come across it.\nIf you have any specific questions about Penn and managing stress while there, please feel free to reach out to me. I always had a very rigorous course load and I was extremely involved on campus but I always found ways to keep myself feeling healthy and positive- even when my natural inclination was not taking me in that direction.

Do not annoy your admit officer. Only send in additional recs if they will add actual new information (not just say how great you are)--don't just send it recs if you already got two good recs. When I was deferred, I treated it as a rejection and I think that was the best way to go. I applied to all my other schools, got into a lot of them, and in the end got to decide to actually come to Penn after looking at all my choices. Bottom line: Most who are deferred get rejected, so just send the interest letter (and make it good!!!! It is actually important) and work on your other apps.

Hope this helps though and feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\"If you haven't already seen this, look at the housing brochure here: http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/sites/www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/files/College_House_Brochure_2015-2016.pdf\nFor recommendations, it really depends. Many incoming freshman put the quad houses (Riepe, Fisher, and Ware) as their top 3 choices, but the quad is not for everyone.\nIf you're looking to live in the quad, just put the 3 houses as your top 3 choices with your room type preference and hope you get into one of them. I wouldn't put too much thought into ordering them. They're all pretty similar in terms of rooms and the experience of living in the quad is basically the same for all 3.\nIf you are looking for a non-quad single, then Stouffer is a good option. It's a quieter atmosphere than the quad, but it also has the advantage of being the closest dorm to the quad (it's right next to it), so if you ever want to hang out with friends in the quad, it's convenient. On the other hand, dorms like Kings Court, Gregory, and Hill are much further away from the quad. Stouffer itself is also mostly freshman, so you will also have the chance to make many friends around your hall.\nIf you want a non-quad double, then applying to Freshman Experience in Harrison can be a good option. You would get to live in an apartment-style suite with a kitchen, private bath, and common room. If you're looking for a non-quad double that isn't in a high rise, then you can choose from Hill, Kings Court, and Stouffer. Out of the three, Stouffer has the most convenient location for a freshman, but there are only a few doubles in Stouffer.\nIf you want a non-quad triple, I'd recommend Mayer Hall. Mayer is probably the nicest dorm on campus, and the rooms are the largest on campus (definitely bigger than the high rises). Even with three people living in one room, you'd all have plenty of space, plus your own common room, bathroom and kitchen. Also, Mayer is organized such that all the freshman live on the 5th and 6th floors, so you won't be isolated from other freshman in any way.\nThere are also some other room types that I haven't mentioned (see page 57 for a full outline of all room possibilities).\nHope this helps. Also consider residential programs in different houses (I mentioned Freshman Experience, but there are many others).\" ", "user_id": "100549930", "user_name": "WhartonPenn2017 ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "205"}, {"date": {"month": "April", "day": "1,", "year": "2017", "time": "8:09PM"}, "comment": "\nHas anybody been able to see what's changed in Hill?\nWhat has the experience been in New House?

That said, it's supposedly around 2-3%. And that said, I got in.\nLet me assure you, I am not the top of my class. I have no national recognition in science or business. I failed my AP's for calculus and physics. After taking the ACT four times I still got no higher than a 33. I sent two subjects tests, both of which were under 750. I had B's in a grand total of 4 semesters before senior year and two in my first semester of senior year, which were sent to Penn.\nI'm writing this because it frustrates me to go through post after post on this website and many others, reading essays, profiles, concerns, and lists of colleges. I see students who are objectively better than me on paper. There are students who have been working in labs every summer for all of high school, working to cure cancer or something of the sort. I read the profiles of kids who are valedictorians, and salutatorians, and national merit scholars, have never gotten below a 5 on an AP ever, and all that kinds of stuff. That kind of profile is so far from where I stand.\nBut here's where things get interesting... I still got in. I've thought for a long time about it, wondering if it was just a fluke, and I've come to the (egotistical) conclusion that no, it was not a fluke. You can have as many clubs, A's, perfect scores, whatever. There are people that do too many things, so many things that it becomes obvious that that person can't possibly have developed a deep connection with anything if they're splitting their time between 20 things all the time.\nAt the end of the day, I've read a lot of essays online that say nothing about who the person actually is. At the end of the day, you have to be authentic, and your love for management and technology has to be authentic as well. I know in my heart that my passion for M&T is strong, authentic, real. I think M&T's also have to fit the program well enough too. There are so many essays for M&T out there that just talk about how it's an unparalleled program for business and engineering and those are two of the most important industries in the world-- no duh. But what is going to drive you to do the work for the next four years? 6 courses every semester for four years is no easy task to commit to-- your passion has to drive you, not the program's prestige. I would say that your \"chances\" are better elsewhere if you're applying to M&T because it's going to get you a good job, high paying internship, prestige, whatever.\nSo, what's the takeaway here? Perfect test scores, grades, or an exorbitant amount of extracurriculars isn't going to get you in. Penn is not a one-dimensional place, and M&T even more so. When they say wholistic review, they mean it. Your essays matter, put time into them. My original purpose in writing this was mostly to give hope to those out there whose heart says apply, but their parents, counselors, inner voice says don't because of what's on the paper. The failed AP, the B on your transcript, the low test scores, they DON'T define you. Remember that. Best of luck to everyone.

But I posted this hoping that it would help kids who, like me, saw M&T and it spoke to them like it spoke to me, but felt so so discouraged by some bad test scores, or messed up AP's. I'm not a believer in APs. They are one time only, extreme tests. Long term hard work is seldom reflected in a high pressure, stressful, 2 week period to show what you're made of, and on crucifying 4 hour, horrible tests.\nBut, I simply hope that future kids will apply to M&T despite a failed AP, or a subpar SAT/ACT. I know I chose to go for it even though I had only the tiniest nugget of hope, but I am eternally grateful to myself for taking that risk. It's hard for 17 year olds to make these choices that affect their entire lives. People should understand that perfect test scores aren't the only route; in fact, many schools reject as many perfect score kids as they accept. I know I was tired of dragging around my failed AP, my few B's, as though they were the end of me. By putting it out there AS an M&T, I just feel as though it's an opposing voice to what I found as an exploring junior, which was only posts that were utterly discouraging.

Furthermore, the comprehensive job placement statistics published by Career Services indicate each year that students in the College and Wharton do equally well finding jobs in their chosen professions after undergraduate studies and gain admissions to the same graduate programs at the same rates.\nIt is commonly believed that Wharton's acceptance rate is about 1 or 2 percentage points lower than that of the College. Essentially the difference between Wharton and the College in terms of admit rate is about the same as the difference between Stanford and Princeton- which is to say, it's negligible.\nWhat does matter for your application to Penn is being able to convey to the school why you belong at Penn and why you belong in your specific program of choice (in your case, Wharton). The Penn admissions department is a well-tuned machine that doesn't have trouble detecting candidates who incorrectly think they'll be able to take advantage of the slightly higher admit rate at the College. And again, the difference between the College and Wharton is so small that it doesn't actually translate into genuinely improved chances of admission and applying without a real interest in the program of study will reduce your chances greatly because you won't look like a good fit for the school. Therefore, it is essential that you apply to the program for which you can honestly express your desire to attend. At the end of the day, Penn's acceptance rate will probably be about 9% again this year and no applicant will have a very good chance of acceptance.

If you apply to CAS with a resume full of business ECs, courses and demonstrated interest in business, and without a good reason as to why you do not want to actually study business, they will sense that you are trying to game the system/are not a good fit for CAS and you will likely get rejected. It is perfectly fine to want to go into business but wanting to study something different, many people at Penn do it and are very successful at breaking into business, but you need to convincingly show that.

This was my essay for bioengineering at UPenn. What do you think? It's very specific to upenn, and i'm really hoping this cuts it. In preparation for the next 13 days, I just wanted to know if this essay was good or not for Upenn.\nTopic : How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying.\nAs a child, my parents constantly worked and did not have enough time to look after me as their main focus was to provide for the family. My grandmother stepped in and, since I was born, she took care of my every need and taught me about my culture, heritage, language, and religion. My extremely close relationship with her only made it hurt more when she was diagnosed with dementia and, over the course of six years, lost her memory and consciousness.\nHowever, my grandmother\u2019s case is only one of many. People everywhere are suffering from maladies ranging from neurological impairments to infectious diseases. I have dreams of sitting in a laboratory or research institution, engineering antimicrobial drugs and fighting flesh-eating pathogens. I have dreams of sitting on the front lines of counter bioterrorism operations and ending the use of biological weapons such as, anthrax. I have dreams of not only making a difference, but also making a lasting impact.\nI began to extend my participation in medical activities to further my understanding of the physiological systems in the human body. I started interning at a pediatrician\u2019s office, helping her take preliminary checks and organizing her vaccines and medications. I learned about penicillin, antibiotics, bacterial infections, and antifungals and became so intrigued in this subject that I began volunteering my hours at the Reston Hospital\u2019s Infection Control Department. Here, I monitored hand hygiene and helped my superiors review the drugs entering the hospital and the cultures the labs were working with. My fascination with these subjects only furthered my desire to make this my life. I wanted to start this path at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe University of Pennsylvania not only offers me a major in bioengineering, but also a variety of concentrations, including Cellular/Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials and Therapeutics, Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine. Along with focusing my undergraduate study in bioengineering, UPenn provides me a pre-medicine focus, so that I can apply my engineering and biomedical background towards clinical studies.\nBy now, I have looked into many universities. However, every other college pales in comparison to Penn Engineering because of its Bioengineered Therapeutics, Devices, and Drug Delivery research concentration. Specifically, the drug and gene therapy applications research are what caught my attention. Under the guidance of nearly 40 graduate faculty members, I will be allowed to become a part of the process in creating disease control systems and efficient drug delivery procedures.\nUPenn Bioengineering also allows me to pursue my love for community service and volunteering. As my family visits India quite often, I have seen the nation\u2019s poverty and how others have had to live and survive. UPenn sponsors local outreach programs in activities such as Engineers without Borders so that I can use my knowledge and skills to benefit my community. In addition, the University lets me extend my involvement globally in the Global Biomedical Service program by giving me the opportunity to volunteer clinical services to underprivileged communities across the world, along with raising my cultural knowledge and awareness.\nThrough a comprehensive curriculum and an abundance of career advancing opportunities, the University of Pennsylvania helps me mold my mind into becoming a biomedical researcher. With the school\u2019s help, I will not only be able to engineer a future for myself, but will also be able to break the barrier between pathogen and remedy.

You don't even have one full full year's GPA and it is hard to extrapolate what your standardized testing will be from an 8th grade score.\nHS should be an experience in and of itself -- a time of learning and growth and not just a 4 year college application prep experience.\nFrom what I have seen over the years the students who get most hurt in the college process are the ones who select a super competitive dream school and then don't get in. I don't want to discourage you from aiming high -- you should aim high -- but no matter what you do in HS, acceptance to Penn is not assured. With under a 10% acceptance rate the school cannot accept all of the qualified applicants. I would urge you when the time comes to seek out a group of reach (including Penn), match, and safety schools that appear affordable and that you would be happy to attend. Often finding those great safety schools is the hardest part of the process.\nIt is good to take school seriously and know that college will be on your horizon, but it is too early to start planning for specific colleges. I would highly recommend that you get off of CC until your junior year. Also it is best to not put your real name of CC in the future.\nFor now you should focus on:\n--Working hard, learning, and doing as well as you can in the most challenging curriculum you can manage.\n--When the time comes study for standardized tests.\n--Continue your involvement in activities you care about and work towards making meaningful contributions to those activities.\n--Enjoying spending time with your family and friends.

I am taking maybe up to 4 AP classes next year however.

I have had two teachers actually ask me if they could write them, and I know that both of these teachers are big fans of me. One has told me that I am his favorite and brightest student ever (and he's been teaching for 15 years), and the other said that I have the most determination and drive of any student he's ever seen. I am expecting that both of these letters will be helpful in getting in.\nCONCLUSION\nI would also definitely apply ED so I have the best chance possible.

Just wanted to quickly clear up some factual inaccuracies from the posts above.\n1. Wharton *is* the \"base\" university. There is no distinction between Wharton and Penn. They are in fact one institution. Wharton just happens to be Penn's business school's name. Similar to the way the school of engineering at Columbia is called the Fu Foundation School of Engineering, Wharton merely connotes the division of Penn in which one is pursuing their education.\n2. Wharton is not significantly more difficult to get into than Penn's other undergrad schools. There is currently no evidence that Wharton's acceptance rate is lower than that of the other three schools since Penn doesn't report admissions rate by individual degree program. Instead, Penn reports one, overall admissions rate for all four undergrad programs (the College, Engineering, Wharton, Nursing). That being said, it is usually assumed that Wharton has an acceptance rate that is around 1 or 2 percentage points lower than that of the College's and Engineering's (others have indicated that Engineering's is now the lowest- but no conclusive evidence has been produced to that effect). Even if Wharton's and Engineering's acceptance rates are about 8% - 9% and the College's is about 9%-10% (which is what is generally assumed to be true, though no concrete evidence exists to fully corroborate the theory), that means the difference in acceptance rate between Wharton and the College is no greater than the difference in acceptance rate between Stanford and Princeton- which is to say, the difference is negligible and one is not genuinely more likely to get into either school over the other.\nGood luck in your college application process, Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about Penn!

Your ACT shouldn't be too low to disqualify you from admission, and you could have a shot depending on the depth and reasoning behind the business award that you received.

During my time at the university, I personally didn't meet many RD Wharton kids who had turned down HYPSM but I sure met many dual degree kids who had done so.@chrizzlez It is not necessary to have a super-focused business applicant profile.

He asked a few friends and others on the Penn 2020 Facebook group if anyone else had received that email- no one else had.

One had gone to writing programs, won an award and had contacted KWH and submitted work. They received a letter that their application would be supported. The other had no formal writing experience but had emailed KWH before ED due date and submitted a portfolio of her work to Jamie-Lee. She received a letter that KWH was supporting her application with admissions. However, she was deferred ED... but happily she was accepted RD!\nIf Penn and participating in KWH is a top desire of yours, I would not hesitate to contact KWH right now....attach a small sampling (or portfolio or whatever you call it) of your writing and ask if they would consider you as a prospective student. Don't hesitate to contact them- there may indeed be a date that you have to submit your work for consideration to Jamie-Lee by... but I'm 99% positive that for RD it hasn't passed yet. If you want you can at the very least call them and find out ( a student will answer the phone and tell you what you need to do).\nIn the link below for prospective students you will see Jamie-Lee's name highlighted ...click on it and it gives you her email... It doesn't hurt to send an email inquiring and telling her of your strong interest ... so you can get in the loop!http://writing.upenn.edu/wh/highlights/prospective.php\nThey will in no way shape or form penalize you for reaching out- if anything it would be the opposite; Penn loves pro-active students! Penn students have to reach out for what they are interested in.\nIf this is a passion or strong interest of yours I would at the very least call or email tomorrow - remember you miss 100% of the shots you don't take!\nPs my son was also asked to apply for a different scholars program at Penn (again one that he hadn't known about) based upon his Penn admissions application/essays... so the admission counselors really do give your application a good read and then pass your info along to prospective programs admissions...

Penn people are competitive first and foremost with themselves, not against each other. Yes Penn is a fast-paced and intense environment but it is also collaborative. I think cutthroat is an exaggeration. For most of my classes there was a lot of collaboration. I would meet with people and do the homework together and also review for exams. People help each other for interview prep and job recruiting, especially many upperclassmen who have gone through it already are willing to help. Of course people are very motivated to succeed and to work extra hard to achieve their goals, so you will face competition by virtue of being surrounded by many seriously motivated people.\nThere is no lack of community, Pen has a very vibrant community. However you have to take initiative and action to find your place on campus. Penn is a rather big school by Ivy,Stanford,MIT standards, located in a major city. It is not a small place where everyone knows each other whether they want to or not (think of Princeton for example). There is a lot going on. If you do not actively try to find your place on campus through involvement in clubs, organizations, groups, and through classes, you can very well end up without a campus community. But if you put yourself out there, you will find your place on campus. This is part of the reason why extracurriculars are such a huge part of Penn.\nAlso the social life is great there. The campus is great and has a lot of offerings but you are also within walking distance of the center of the city so you can explore the city offerings too.\nAs for the tuition yes, since you will not have to go into debt and your family budget will not be strained greatly, it is definitely worth it. Penn of course offers a top notch education, you will meet amazing, smart people and also its salary and career outcomes are some of the highest amongst top schools.

Furthermore, Penn has all of its graduate, undergraduate institutions, medical research centers, and hospitals all on one campus, unlike JHU which has its hospital and med school separated from its undergrad campus. As a consequence of Penn's One University Policy, you are also encouraged to do research at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Med, and there are several Penn Integrates Knowledge professors that hold dual appointments in both the med school and the school of arts and sciences as well as Engineering, increasing your access to potential mentors who know the ins and outs of med school applications.\nAlso, Philly and the area around Penn is just more fun and nicer than the area around JHU and Baltimore in general.\n\"Where Hopkins is now, Penn was, say, in 1996\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/university-as-pillar-of-community\nHopkins and Baltimore are getting there-- but Penn led the way in sustainable and inclusive urban redevelopment initiatives and it has paid off big time in terms of quality of life for Penn students and faculty.\nAdditionally, Penn students definitely know how to work hard but they also know when to put the books away.

I had a couple of friends who did Parli and they absolutely loved it. They travel to all of the major tournaments and prepare with one another for debates.

So if you've been rejected by Wharton, you've been rejected by Penn and thus your admissions cycle with regard to Penn would be over. That being said, if you apply to one of the dual degree programs (for example, M&T which is between Wharton and Engineering), you can request to be considered for both the dual degree program AND (in the alternative) to one of the 2 schools in the program if you are not accepted to the dual degree program. So let's say you apply to M&T and get rejected but you put down that you would also like to be considered for admission to Wharton's regular, single-degree program, it is still possible to be accepted to Wharton even though you've been rejected by M&T. Dual degree programs, however, are the only instances in which you can be rejected but still considered for admission to another program at Penn.\nHope that helps!

My bio teacher has known me since freshman year because he was my chem teacher too, and my calc teacher wrote a strong rec because I used to tutor kids who were struggling in his class a lot. Both an 8-9/10\nTeacher Rec #1: AP Bio (8.5)\nTeacher Rec #2: AP Calc (8.5)\nCounselor Rec: Counselor's don't know any of us so it's probably really generic (6).\nAdditional Rec: So last year, I took history honors with one of my teachers. I got extremely close with this teacher and I used to talk with her all the time after school and she knows almost every detail of my life. She got breast cancer (thankfully she is doing a lot better now) and I used to email her while she was on medical leave. We even had coffee at the end of junior year together at a Starbucks. I know UPenn values personal qualities a lot, and I'm really hoping this recommendation shows them I'm a good person (haha i know). I would rate this rec a 10.5/10\nInterview: My interview went extremely well (lasted for over an hour). He was from Penn Engineering and he thought I was a perfect fit for the school and told me he would write me a stellar report. At one point we were talking about Netflix shows so it seemed he was interested in talking to me.\nOther: So I take AP Art in my school and I submitted a portfolio with about 8 of my best works. The focus is on design (the Admissions officers said this would be relevant to my major so it would work in my favor). Out of everything, I guess this is what sets me apart from the other engineering applicants.\nWhat do you guys think my chances are? Upenn is definitely a reach for me and I don't really expect I get in (Though this is my #1 school so here's hoping) but I think it's possible I have a shot. I didn't apply ED because I heard even though the acceptance rate is higher the applicant pool is stronger and it's possible I would be rejected rather than deferred.

To me, especially looking at your senior first semesters and seeing that you got a B in AP Bio, though you want to be a bioengineering major, would maybe make me a little confused. Also, you want to be an bioengineering major and didn't take AP physics? I'm just a little confused, and maybe your school doesn't offer physics, which then would be in no way held against you. You've taken a fair amount of APs, which shows strength in course load, which is a good thing and will maybe help balance out the semi-low UW GPA.

Sorry if this makes you depressed, just trying to give you a realistic picture here. Do you at least have leadership in something? How are you going to stand out? Do you do anything more interesting than the school newspaper? Your GPA could use work.\nAnd no offense, but you basically have zero chance for wharton. Everyone tries to transfer into wharton. And transferring in is even harder than getting in regular, which is also notoriously difficult. Moreover, people who transfer into wharton are the type who know the stock market back and forth, who are entrenched in all the finance-related clubs their current school has to offer. They are entrepreneurial and can show they've clearly taken initiative. Even if you are first generation, it's a stretch for you.\nAlso, the reality of the situation is, even though they say this isn't true, all universities like to take rich people in as transfers--aka people who can pay full tuition. There are a bunch of fantastic people trying to transfer in, but they can only take so many, you know? So when it comes down to it, they'll decide over money. It's just a reality.\nIf you're really set, then I suggest you do two things. First, really understand what sets you apart from everyone else in the applicant pool. Why you? What can you bring to the school? (and don't give some **** answer like \"my passion\", everyone does that. You need something more personal that can link to the school. Find a way to write this story) Why should they chose you over everyone else? If you don't have anything, make it. Penn's all about making your own opportunities. Second, I would talk to some of the professors. Reach out to them, cold-email them. I had a friend who cold emailed about a hundred professors at UPenn as a high schooler to do research with them over the summer. One prof accepted, wrote a stellar rec for this kid later, and he swears that that's what got him into penn.\nI really do wish you the best of luck. Hope you find the right fit for you. If you haven't already, really ask yourself \"why penn\"? Do your research, and by that I don't mean through their website, I mean through current students there. Culture is everything in college, and UPenn has a very distinctive social, work hard play hard culture. If that's not 1000% you, I don't think penn is the right choice.

It is really helpful. However I do have several objections that I believe you are selling me short on.\n1) I'm not applying to Wharton, I am applying CAS for econ. BIG difference. I was just wondering the chances if I did apply, but I know it is naturally VERY low. I hear the CAS acceptance rate is ~16-18% for transfers which is significantly higher than regular admissions.\n2) I am grateful that I would be able to pay full tuition. I am paying full at Emory and even if I was low-income, UPenn does have a strong financial aid program and is actually need-blind so my financial situation does not play a role in admissions as you say it does.\n3) I understand that my essay is crucial and will put everything into it as I always have.\n4) My resume and involvement at Emory is solid. I did not feel like disclosing all my club involvements as I would prefer to remain anonymous.\n5) Cold-emailing hundreds of professors is a really bad idea haha. It may work in networking for a job, but the last thing I want to do is piss off a professor on the admissions board because who would help one of hundreds of potential transfers that they don't even know or care about when they have a full-time job?\n6) Emory is a very competitive school and is of similar academic caliber to UPenn. I took five classes my first semester in hard classes and I think that proves my ability to succeed in an intense academic setting.\nI would also advise you to peruse through the threads of previous UPenn transfers who were admitted. There are those with similar and even lower stats than mine that were admitted. I am not saying that will guarantee admissions and in fact your probably right in that I have less than a 50-50 chance in getting in, but ultimately I think you're selling me way short when you really don't know anything about me.

Penn does say that any bump for legacy will be given in the early round, but I'm not sure that is different from other schools - Penn just comes out and says it.\nBasically all recruited athletes will apply in the early round at all Ivy League schools, so Penn is no different from Harvard in this respect. The difference is that the number of recruited athletes is fixed at about 200 +/- per Ivy League university, so as a percentage, it's higher at Harvard compared to Penn due to the freshman class size.\nThere have many many threads trying to parse ED/EA rates backing out athletes/legacy, etc, which you can look at. Personally, I think looking at those is a waste of time. I think EA/ED will be a boost, but for both Penn and Harvard, they will not admit a student in the early round that they would not have admitted RD.\nIf Harvard's your first choice, apply there SCEA.
