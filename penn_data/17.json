I don't know of any Bio majors who didn't take 114.\nI think a better question would be whether there is a better course for your daughter to take next semester. If she has a good idea of the college she'll attend (even if it's narrowed to 3 or 4 options), then she can take a look at the requirements each school has for its biology majors, including which courses are transferable. Some schools may allow you to transfer credit to apply toward your major; others allow you to transfer credit to apply toward general requirements; still others allow you to transfer credit only as an elective. These policies could inform your daughter as to which course to look at. For example, if she can transfer credit to apply toward a major, then maybe introductory biology might make sense, but if she can't do that, then she runs the risk of taking the same class twice.

It could be 15% A's, it could be 4% A's, it could be Harvard and everyone gets an A. Haha.\nGrades are not pats on the back for completing a course. Grades are a metric to see where a person stands in their class. It may seem tough that Wharton has such a harsh curve, but someone who graduates summa cum laude will have plenty of job offers because employers know that they truly were at the top of his or her class. Mastering material is relative in the real world, it all comes down to who knows the most and that is what the Wharton curve does. Yea it sucks sometimes when a 95% raw score on a test is a B, but at the end of the day your classmates that scored above you deserve a higher score and a higher GPA because of it. Curving creates stress, but it makes the cream rise to the top.\nAdam Grant is a truly wonderful professor and person who I have personally talked to. I think that he is allowed to do whatever grading he wants. However, the thought that Wharton should eliminate the curved courses because they create stress is ridiculous. If someone can't handle the stress of a Wharton class they sure can't handle the stress of the real world. I look at Wharton as a small microcosm of the business world. It is competitive, people want to be the best, but ultimately to succeed it comes down to the people you know and how they can help. The burden is on the students to overcome the boundaries made by the curve (or the desire for promotions in the real world) to work together because it is in their common interests. Without the curve we might be closer, we might have more friends and a more \"fun\" college experience, but at the end of the day we are students in the best undergraduate business school because we want to be the best in business. The Wharton curve helps to make that happen and eliminating it would be a disservice to the students.

You are correct, people are promoted for a variety of reasons other than specific knowledge and it would be naive to think otherwise; however, my words were not meant to be taken that literally. The best analyst in the class is given great rewards and prestige even if the second analyst is just close behind. The PhD student with the most groundbreaking research is hired by the best universities.

Honestly I think it can be both a bad and a good thing. It means that students at Penn are way more conscious and pressured from very early on to make plans about their summers during college and their career after graduation. Yes without a doubt this adds a lot of pressure and can get overwhelming at times, but it has its positive aspects too namely that it provides a sense of direction and motivation and also toughens the students up and prepares them for the real world. This could be especially beneficial for liberal arts majors.\nPenn is not for everyone and it is not a cosy environment where the students will be coddled. In general, students who enjoy and thrive under competition and students who are also social and can juggle intense academics with extracurriculars will tend to enjoy Penn the most.\nThat said from my experience there has always been help from professors and TAs if you approach them, go to their office hours, and also from your peers both in terms of academics and job search. There are many upperclassmen who take time out of their schedule to prep their underclassmen acquaintances for interviews and give them advice etc. Also for many of my classes students out of their own initiative would form study groups to do the homework problems and even study for the midterms. There is collaboration for sure in addition to intense competition.\nAlso Penn is big school in a major city, so it can get overwhelming. Finding one or more organizations on campus makes a huge difference in terms of social life and also the help and mentorship one can receive from peers. I would suggest that freshmen and also prospective applicants keep that in mind.\nLastly, as I said Penn is not for everyone. Don't choose Penn because of the name, it is an ivy etc. The ivy+ schools are very similar in many ways but also have big have differences. While you could feel at home and thrive in one, you could completely not fit into another one.

Penn has amazing students. They work hard. Northwestern has great students too. These are two outstanding schools. Their students can all compete at a high level or they would not be there. D has taken courses at both schools. In her experience, Penn is a bit tougher, but she likes both schools. You will need to put on your big boy pants at both schools. I suspect for most students the differences are minor.\nStill, students do not tend to be cut-throat. They tend to work cooperatively through very challenging courses. At Penn, the typical student's level of social connectivity is high. Because of that social connectivity, any cut-throat behavior is likely to be extinguished quickly through the social network.\nPenn students will tend to be doers, who are very involved outside of class, and highly socially engaged with peers. That it true in comparison to almost any other university. They really make the most of their four years in class and out. They will tend to be more pre-professional and setting up their linked-in accounts as freshmen, seeking internships and research opportunities as freshmen and sophomores. Impressively, they are reasonably successful in getting results. Again, they tend to want to do things, not just read books and listen to lectures.\nI really think that which school is better depends on the student, their major, interests, preferences, and goals. You have to investigate and consider which school is best for you. For my D, Penn is a better fit, but if she had ended up being a Wild Cat, I would have been thrilled about that too.

Thus, I have been looking into the process for applying for a dual degree through Wharton or transferring into the M&T program. However, the course requirements to apply found here: https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/itdd-requirements/ indicate that one must take Econ 001 and 002 by the end of the Spring semester to apply for entry into Wharton for Sophomore fall. Currently, while I do have a class in Wharton (added it as an elective bearing in mind that I may try to apply for a dual degree), I am not enrolled in Econ 001, which is in the College (kind of counterintuitive for being a prerequisite to apply to Wharton internally...). Since it's not possible to take both Econ 001 and 002 in the Spring, does this mean I'm pretty much screwed out of any chance to go for a dual degree since I don't have AP Credit for Econ? It seems a little ridiculous to be disqualified for not knowing something like this in the first couple weeks as a freshman, especially since it isn't exactly obvious since Econ 001 is not a Wharton class. Further, my advisor never mentioned I would have to do take Econ 001 in the fall when I expressed interest in doing the dual degree.\nAm I missing something? Any advice is appreciated.

Computer Science is the most popular major in SEAS right now. It is very rigorous, and a good balance of theory and practice. The extracurricular opportunities that are available to students are amazing.\nStudents are very good at Penn. If you are the type of student who likes to be with peers then it will be great. If you need to feel special like you are the smartest student in each class, then don't go to Penn. Students also tend to be very involved in clubs activities and social life. That means schedules are very full.\nHomework and projects can be extensive at times. You need to be able to hang tough. That is more about focus and mindset than anything else. It clearly isn't for everyone.\nMany students have minors or take classes in other schools. Mine has finished a math minor in CAS and has begun working on a statistics minor in Wharton.\nThe demand for Penn graduates is high. Last year the average grad had over 2 offers. Salaries of graduates are close to the highest in CS. The 2015 reported rase was $70k-135k, and the average was $98k. http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/files/SEAS_2015SeniorCPSurvey.pdf ", "user_id": "100505398", "user_name": "Much2learn ", "user_thread_count": "168", "user_comment_count": "4610"}, {"date": {"month": "October", "day": "6,", "year": "2016", "time": "8:31AM"}, "comment": "\nI should add that I may be able to be more helpful, if you have a specific question.

However, it can depend on how may AP credits you have and how many courses you take per semester. Also she does have to prioritize the minors. She finished the math minor, and is partially done with a Stat minor but may not finish it because she has discovered that she can complete a MSE in only 1 added semester if she sub-matriculates, and schedules carefully, but that may cause her to be a couple classes short of the Stat minor. I told her the Stat classes she is taking are valuable whether she has an official minor or not, and she should pursue what she wants to pursue. If she stays on this path, she will graduate on-time in May with her BSE, and again that December with her MSE.\n2. \"Did your son or daughter have any trouble registering for classes that were needed?\"\nShe hasn't had much difficulty with that. A little jostling but nothing important. For example she had to take a different English course that she initially planned once because her first choice was full, but it has not been a big problem.\n3.\"Is there a collaborative environment among the students in SEAS?\"\nYes. Penn students tend to be sociable and collaborative. Students will work hard for a grade, but more like you are all in it together, not against one another. MIT is very much like that too.\n4. \"Are the professors accessible?\"\nYes. She goes to see professors often. Penn is unusual in that all professors teach. Also, in SEAS, new material in classes can only be taught by a professor. Professors are not allowed to delegate lectures to grad assists.\n5. \"Are there lectures and seminars offered to help students decide where to focus within computer science?\"\nThere are many lectures and opportunities to hear speakers and explore various topics in CS. You will also begin to develop preferences via classes. Additionally, most sophomores and juniors seem to be able to get internships. That is very helpful in exploring interests.\n6. \"How is the advising?\"\nFor the first two years she had coffee once per month with her faculty advisor. For the first two years she had coffee once per month with her faculty advisor, he was amazing and a huge help. I understand that is not everyone's experience. I am sure it depends on which faculty advisor you get, but each student does have a faculty advisor.\n7. \"You mentioned amazing extracurriculars... can you give any specifics?\"\n-She has been involved in Hack4Impact. They create software to support non-profit organizations. She has gained a lot of hands on experience by doing that.\n-She has also been involved in Women in Computer Science. They have speakers, mentoring, a hack-a-thon.\n-Penn Apps is the largest college Hack-a-thon in the country. It is convenient to have that on campus. She isn't a huge hack-a-thon fan, but is good at it. Her Penn team of four students placed 3rd this summer at an invitation-only hack-a-thon at Facebook headquarters. That is typical of the quality of the peers you get at Penn.\n-She was a research assistant for a Wharton professor.\n-She went on a Tech-Treck. A group of 15-20 students visited tech companies in Silicon Valley. About half were SEAS students and half were from Wharton. She learned a lot about a number of tech companies. They were all companies with Penn Alumni in senior positions. I think it was a 5 or 6 day trip over fall or spring break.

He is currently home on Fall break and just gave me an in-depth 4 hour run down...\nHe has found everyone to be super friendly and extremely willing to collaborate. He has several courses where it is imperative for students collaborate to succeed. Penn CAS and Wharton, along with management 100 course where Wharton students are put in groups to run a non profit project, are implementing these S.A.I.L. courses for several mandatory courses. SAIL stands for Structured, Active, In-Class, Learning courses, which emphasize self-reliance in education. (basically you have to teach yourselves the material in small groups)http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/01/sail-courses-met-with-criticism\nWhile he hates this type of learning, because it is very hard to teach yourselves the course , he said it makes it imperative that you learn to work together. He mentioned that while there are many super bright students in his classes, there are also many athletes (guessing about 35%?) that are struggling. This helps out the \"curve\". He said he felt there is definitely a disparity between the two groups... and feels bad that many are struggling but at the same time, its not bc of cut throat competition or anything its just that some may get things much quicker... Penn does have free tutoring help available.\nAs far as the music industry connections... he has no idea, but did mention that he has heard a freshman in the college is transferring to pursue the music business in LA. I am sure Penn (and Wharton) does open many doors including the music industry, but you do have to be willing to sacrifice 4 years to pursue the college education/degree and this student didn't want to wait.\nThat said, my son said if you told him last year he would be spending this much time studying, reading, and working, he wouldn't have believed it. But what is more amazing to him, is that it is not at all un-manageable. It is manageable, he is thriving and growing more inspired by the day. He loves that everyone is committed to this education environment. Its a heady environment for him...\nWhat has been frustrating for him so far, has been the fact that the clubs are uber competitive to join. So to be accepted into a club, you have to submit a resume and an application, go on 4 rounds of interviews, only to be told you didn't get in. If you do this for 20 clubs, you will be lucky to get in 1 or max 2. And this is all in the first month of freshman year. You really need to figure out which clubs you want to join before school starts and then bring your A game to compete.

How diverse is it in terms of conservative/liberal ratio? how much importance is given to political discourse on campus (for example, is it as active as Yale?)? how PC is it (I find PC culture insufferable but that's just me)? notable political clubs/events? Is there an activism culture (like that of Columbia for example?). Thanks!\nP.S. I'm also into dark, often offensive, humor (think Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle, Louis CK on a bad day, Bill Maher, etc.).

Students will participate in protests, etc., but most of them need a solid reason. There are always exceptions but most students will just be annoyed if you want to protest the General's chicken being made with a healthier recipe.\nA lot depends on what you mean by PC culture. In my experience, people mean many things by PC.\nRecently, a Trump supporter told me that Muslims are dangerous, and he doesn't like gays either. I said I thought his statements were much too broad and inappropriate. He said I was just being PC, and pointed out, correctly, that he can say whatever he wants to. Then, when I said I I didn't like his Islamophobic and homophobic comments, he claimed my comment was offensive, and he should not have to put up with it. I think his hateful comments are offensive, and he thinks hating other people is fine, but pointing out his hate is offensive.

Instead the activist are actively making a difference volunteering in the West Philadelphia and Philadelphia communities hands on. I do remember bloody dresses hanging on every lamppost on Locust Walk in support of Black Trans lives though during last year's family weekend - ... so activism is not always unseen.\nFree speech protests did shut down prematurely a CIA speaker last spring http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/04/cia-protest-update but the students used that incident to spark a debate after...\nI think most Penn students are extremely embracing and proud of their diversity. They are a peace loving group so they came out en mass to support the lgbt community last week when a homophobic preacher set up shop on campus http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/09/homophobic-protest-button-reactions\nThere is a huge campaign going on about rape culture awareness right now. http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/09/students-react-online-to-rape-culture-flyers\nTo be honest, if you really find political correctness \"insufferable\", I think you will most definitely be in the minority at Penn- most students error on the side of PC because (A.) its polite and non offensive (B.) its important to understand and appreciate diverse groups and how all can interact with each other that supports everyones dignity, safety, and intellectual experience.\nAs to the offensive dark humor?

Much2learn, I understand what you mean by the variance in experience of PC culture. I'm totally on your side on that debate, I hate open bigotry and unfair generalizations in the name of free speech. However, the PC culture I am wary of is the one where criticism of Islam or any other religion as a doctrine and a set of ideas is unfairly conflated with bigotry against Muslims as people, or where people get offended and shout down professors over Halloween costumes like at Yale, or where the only feminists around are typical misandry-prone radicals, or where white people are constantly reminded of their past transgressions and made to feel unfairly guilty (like what students at Pomona did in their freshmen dorm rooms recently). I'm all for appreciating diversity and being non-offensive to minorities and culturally sensible (I'm from South East Asia myself! ) , I'm just not comfortable with that sort of radical PC-ness, if you will.\nI'm very liberal myself, so you can expect me joining the rally against the homophobic priest-type guys. I also understand that some students might take issue with the CIA guy, as his term as director coincided with the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture and revelations of global surveillance, so I can't say I'm completely against that. I was just wondering whether Penn is one of those ultra-liberal LAC type colleges, where every dissenting opinion is considered hate-speech, where perfectly reasonable people such as Christina Hoff Sommers are banned for seemingly no reason (Oberlin 2015), where students gets triggered over the slightest provocation.

Before gay marriage equality was the law of the land, the College Republicans and the Penn Democrats had a joint campaign to promote marriage equality. Students on campus did \"ferguson fridays\" where they would protest perceived police brutality against minority communities every friday on Locust Walk. They did a \"die in\" at President Amy Gutmann's house once (she joined them and the Penn Police got a little miffed at her but it's all patched up now).\nAt the same time, Penn has a very vocal conservative movement on campus. Anti-LGBT Rights speakers have come to campus. Newt Gingrich was hosted. Frank Luntz was hosted. Eric Cantor *was* coming to Penn to speak until he found out his speech was open to the general public and not just Penn students (that's the story he's sticking to, anyway). Penn has had two alums run for the republican nomination in the last 2 elections (College of Arts and Science alum and former Governor of Utah/Ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, Jr. and a certain business mogul that you've probably never heard of  ). So there's definitely a commitment to political discourse across the board.\nBUT-- this is not Columbia. There is much less patience for activism that interferes with class, extracurriculars, job opportunities, and the atmosphere on campus. A lot of political disagreements between students also get swept under the rug when it comes time to party on Saturday night. You are unlikely to find a student willing to carry around a mattress for her entire senior year to bring awareness to rape culture. Though Penn students have been canvassing campus with flyers to bring awareness to the issue. I can't really imagine students shouting down a professor over halloween costumes. In fact, when students wouldn't let Amy Gutmann respond to criticisms during the party at her house at which students performed a \"die in,\" other students were yelling \"let her speak!\" All of this is to say that Penn is liberal at its core but it's not nearly as extreme in its activism as Columbia. There were protests at Penn in the 60s but the ones that everyone knows about happened at Berkeley and Columbia. That's pretty much how it is today too.\nYou'll be fine at Penn as long as you are polite, respectful, and your opinions are well reasoned and grounded in logic, not bigotry.

Just to be clear, I'm an alum of both Chicago and Penn - it's why I post in both these forums. Further, I'm aware that the officially endorsed shorthands for both these schools are UChicago and Penn. Nevertheless, for variety in my posts (and to thumb my nose a little at each school's insistence on their chosen monikers), I occassionally refer to UChicago as Chicago, or U of C. At times, I refer to Penn as UPenn.\nInitial commentary aside, I'm disappointed by the themes present in your post. Penn changed their ED policy THIS year, in a way that restricts student latitude, and my argument is this raises the level of inequity present in early decision at Penn. Further, I'm fairly sure I describe the situation that spurred Penn to change their policy (namely, students opting out of their ED agreement).\nHere's your thesis: \"Top students need to decide whether they are committed to attending Penn, if admitted, and paying the parental contribution. If a student is not clear on that, they should not apply ED.\"\nYou state this matter of factly, but it presents the unfairness present in ED - it entirely favors the school. I believe that, in past years, some students rightfully tested the limits of the policy, and dove into the grey areas of what wasn't expressly prohibited.\nAs seen in @runswimyoga post, UPenn asks the family to present what they believe they can afford to pay. Penn might not actually cover the difference. This is for institutional protection, of course - many families (no matter how wealthy) probably underestimate how much they're willing to pay. At the same time, this is exactly why students like to compare options from different colleges - they can compare which package best matches THEIR own idea of what they're willing to pay. (With the presumption that any family would prefer to pay close to $0 for the best education possible.)\nAny student should have the latitude to compare packages and make a decision that's the most financially advantageous (note - I didn't say financially feasible) decision for them. ED takes away from that ability. Restrictive ED takes away from that ability even more. Even other Penn posters (like @Penn95) believe this policy change to be petty. Your posts, however, seem to defend a policy that's heightening inequities.\nYou state that any applicant who opts out of the ED agreement \"breaks the rules\" - but these are rules Penn created (and tightened this year) purely for its own benefit! There is inherent unfairness in these rules. Outside of the administration, who would state this so matter of factly? All parents and applicants should lament ED, and restrictive ED specifically.\nFor a discussion of how Penn pioneered this unfortunate system, see this article on the \"Early Decision Racket\": http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/09/the-early-decision-racket/302280/.\nFinally, I think I'm quite clear on how ED works in practice. My assertions (that a tiny fraction of ED admits tried to leverage other options), in fact, likely provided Penn with the reasoning it needed to change its rules this year. How you describe ED is most likely how it will work in the future, as Penn has tightened their rules because of students (justly, in my view) adroitly managing their options.\nBut, all rules for the benefit of the school, and all glory to UPenn!

Wouldn't these applicants still be able to \"break\" the rules in the exact same way as those who received merit aid at a private school did last year?\nPenn's new policy is puzzling, because it STILL doesn't fully stop applicants from \"breaking\" the rules, no?\nFurther, let's unpack this a little more. Why does UPenn care (to the extent that they needed to change policy) about the TINY subset of students good enough to get merit scholarships at top private schools who then turn down Penn ED? Let's say (optimistically) that 15 students in the pool did this last year.\nDid UPenn change the policy out of some indignant outrage that .08% of its accepted students decided to \"break\" the rules? Was this tiny subset of students really so powerful as to \"harm the many\" in the greater group?\nGiven all the scholarship/news out there about the cynical, zero-sum game of college admissions (look at the article I linked to above, read Jerome Karabel's work on admissions at Harvard et. al., follow articles in the Wash Post and NY Times, etc.), your lack of skepticism here is worrying.\nI can hardly fault that tiny subset for making a decision that was best to them, and arguably staying within the grey area of determining one's best \"financial need.\" Penn's decision to take insult with the actions of this minuscule fraction, however, certainly deserves blame.\nFinally, you know who is making the admissions process \"not great\"? It's not the 15-20 kids a year who opt out of the ED agreement. It's the schools themselves - with Penn and Chicago being the frontrunners in needless shenanigans.

However, I DO wonder what Penn and its Admissions Office might be doing in response to Penn's recent US News rankings, falling from a high of #4 to the current #9, especially given that the rankings of peers such as Chicago, Duke, and Columbia have risen past Penn's ranking during that same period. I would imagine that there must be some pressure to drive Penn's ranking up relative to its peers, and significantly lowering their acceptance rates while maintaining or increasing average SATs, etc. has been one of the methods used by those peers to enhance their rankings.

Now what place it has in the top 10 is less of a priority in my opinion, since it is widely known and understood that the relative positions within the top 10 do not have, for the most part, great significance and are not accurate reflections of the relative standings of the schools. For example Stanford is ranked at the same place as Columbia and Chicago and below Yale, which nowadays most would agree in rather inaccurate. Also most would argue that the different positions of Penn, Duke, Columbia, Chicago do not reflect any substantial relative differences between the schools, and do not change the widely held perception that these four schools are the next tier after HYPS. (I consider MIT, Caltech in a group of their own given their specialization and don't compare them with the others).\nWhat is significant for the perception/desirability/standing of a school is a constant presence in the top 10, and out of all the top 10 schools, Penn, Columbia, Chicago and Duke need the most to remain in the top 10, given that they are the weaker brands of the top 10, and thus stand to benefit the most from inclusion in that top group.\nPenn is at a disadvantage in that its class is significantly larger than the other schools, so it is more difficult to drive down acceptance rate (although yield is around the same/ a bit higher than Columbia, Chicago).

I majored in both History and English and absolutely loved both. Each was incredibly well funded, had outstanding faculty defining their fields, had small classes/intensive seminars/exciting lectures/incredible guest speakers/etc. etc. etc. It is a common *misconception* that the humanities are in some way overshadowed at Penn by the pre-professional schools. Instead, because students who legitimately want to study business or engineering have schools to which they can matriculate at Penn, you probably won't find a wannabe finance major in your Economic History concentration. At the same time, you might find an *actual* finance concentrator in your Economic History class because they are genuinely passionate about the perspective a humanities course like this offers-- but nobody is forced forced to take that class for lack of offerings in their legitimate fields of interest as you will find at other top schools that lack Penn's breadth and depth of course offerings among its undergrad/graduate/professional schools.\nFurthermore, Penn's history programs are among the absolute best, and in some cases, second to none. Penn's overall history department at the graduate level is consistently ranked among the top 10 programs in the country which means that the best scholars and grad students are coming to Penn to teach AND do research (95% of classes in Penn's College of Arts and Sciences are taught by full time faculty members who also do research. They value both equally and know that both teaching and research informs the other in mutually beneficial ways). Because of Penn's One University Policy, you have access to both undergrad classes (already taught by these fantastic scholars), and Penn's graduate history resources/courses as well as research opportunities galore that allow you to make substantive contributions to the field. Two of my friends who majored in history are now pursuing PhDs in their respective historical disciplines-- both at the top programs for their fields of study. With regard to strong areas, USNews consistently ranks Penn either 1st or 2nd in US Colonial History and Penn's resources combined with the research facilities throughout Philadelphia will give you access to one of the richest sets of archives on American Colonial history in the world. Penn is also ranked in the top 10 for Women's History, Modern US History, and is ranked #12 for European History at the graduate level. Again, graduate rankings at most universities wouldn't matter to an undergrad but at Penn, you will easily be able to enjoy the benefits that these outstanding grad programs bring to Penn. I can say from experience that the resources poured into the history department are superb and undergrads are encouraged at every level to take full advantage of them. Advising is pretty outstanding and unlike at some other top universities, you will have both a major advisor within the history department, an academic advisor from the College, and a pre-major advisor who might be in the history department if you list that as your intended major before you matriculate. You get to keep all three as you move through your program of study and at any turn you can look to each of them for advice and guidance. The grad students at Penn are also amazing resources for budding PhD students because they've been through it all before. They can provide invaluable advice if you are interested in following in their footsteps.\n(And as a side note-- the history department isn't the only traditional strength at Penn- outstanding programs in the humanities can be found across the board and they all serve to reinforce the others. From Sociology, to English to Economics, Penn's Arts & Sciences program is truly exemplary.)\nThe history department is also housed in Penn's most beautiful, historic building, College Hall. It is literally at the heart of the University both physically and intellectually. From the outside, Penn can seem like a very pre-professional place-- and that is definitely a big element of campus life. But that pre-professionalism does not exist at the exclusion of the intellectual life of the university. Mainstream culture at any Ivy is going to be heavily focused on Wall Street and that's especially true at Penn. But your experience does not have to be defined by pre-professionalism unless you want it to be your focus. I loved being a humanities student at Penn because I knew that even though i was studying History and English, I was still going to be able to get a job in a highly coveted field afterwards that would position me well for the rest of my career and graduate school pursuits with the help of Penn's outstanding career services that help all undergraduate students equally. Speaking from experience, the choice to come to Penn and study history and english has DEFINITELY paid off. And *most* of my friends would agree. No experience is perfect, but a Penn education will truly be what you make of it!\nFeel from to send me a message with any specific questions you might have-- i'm happy to answer them!

And as for English, I genuinely think the Penn experience is second to none!\nAt the graduate level Penn has been ranked #4 behind only Berkeley, Harvard and Stanford for a while now and as usual, Penn undergrads are given full access to the amazing resources that those strong grad programs bring to the University. While larger classes (about 50-60 students) are possible to find in the department, they are comparatively few and far between. If you are interested in a small, close-knit community of dedicated scholars and students then the English department is perfect for you. I took English classes exclusively taught by full professors with only 12-25 students my entire time at Penn. There were always significantly more courses that interested me than I could take, each engaging with any number of genres, temporal foci, critical disciplines, etc. etc. The department is overflowing with faculty talent and scholarly output and yet the professors adore teaching undergrads across the board. Undergrads often act as research assistants to professors alongside grad students and they can easily gain experience editing and even writing sections of articles and books. The building in which the English department is housed is also absolutely gorgeous and was renovated since you've last seen it! (https://vimeo.com/166260945 check out this video to see it). I cannot speak highly enough about the English department at Penn (and if I were FORCED to choose, I would say my favorite classes at Penn were English courses, though I came into Penn assuming I'd only study history). The English major at Penn gave me the skills I needed to think critically and carefully about language, both my own and that of others. While my posts here may not reflect that because i often write them in great haste, I know that the way in which Penn's professors held me accountable for my use of language made me a significantly more discerning writer. While professors in subjects like political science were often (though certainly not always) focused more exclusively on the content of my ideas, English professors always demanded that the ideas be well presented in addition to being well reasoned, deeply thought out, rigorously researched, and well supported.\nIn terms of the classroom/homework experience, it was challenging but manageable (much like most classes at Penn). It was always funny to me when students from other departments and schools would remark on how much reading they had because there were many courses in the English department that would require you to read an entire book per week (about 400 pages in addition to all of your other classes) and write a 3 page essay about each book. It is always possible to shy away from the most rigorous courses but most students at Penn thrive on the challenge and many courses offer it. Of course the way in which one reads as an undergrad reading is a lot less challenging and time consuming, but the workload is certainly not light when coupled with your other classes and extracurriculars. Classes are collaborative and students are all encouraged to participate. Classroom participation can often count for about 5% of your overall grade. There are rarely exams in class. Usually, students are required to write papers for their midterms and finals which makes it a good major to pair with more exam-intensive majors like history or economics. The papers are fun to write, however, and the intellectual exercise is outstanding for students who love reading and writing. For a time I considered getting an English PhD and was surprisingly close to matriculating at a program when I ultimately decided to forgo the opportunity for a job I had lined up from earlier in my senior year. Every professor I asked about pursuing a PhD, however, offered great advice and shared their very honest perspective on the state of academia and the utility of the English PhD. Professors were excited to write recommendations and the small classroom setting in which we engaged made building faculty relationships and demonstrating my promise as a potential PhD student very easy.\nIt also feels like one of the majors least aware of the pre-professional vibe at Penn. The classes and faculty definitely have an outward facing, worldly orientation and their scholarship reflects their engagement with the real world, but not in the same way as econ or sociology, if that makes sense.\nFinally, the Kelly Writers House is such a wonderful asset to the university. It is this amazing hub for all things literature and writing. There are poetry readings by the most famous poets and students alike. They host visiting journalists and best selling authors. And if you aren't aware, you MUST check out the Fellows program (http://www.writing.upenn.edu/wh/people/fellows/). To be able to engage so closely with the literary powerhouses of our lifetime is an opportunity that is truly not available in such an intimate and meaningful way anywhere else in higher education.\nPenn english majors go on to do all sorts of incredible things as well. Some become doctors, others become lawyers. Some become writers (Buzz Bissinger of Friday Night Lights fame, for example), singer/song writers (John Legend, for example), business leaders (Rich Ross of Disney and Discovery Channel, for example) and more. The sky is the limit with a Penn english degree in hand.\nPlease let me know if i can elaborate in any way. I love the English department at Penn and I so truly hope your daughter considers it carefully. It is a very special place in and of itself and especially within the context of a world class research university in the heart of one of America's most beautiful and historic cities.

I am a Penn alum from several decades ago, I was a Psych major. I think Penn was and is a fantastic school. But I currently have a kid applying to colleges who is very different than I am. I kind of liked being \"anonymous\" in a big school like Penn. My kid likes to be part of a closeknit community (something that was not important for me when I attended). My kid is very interested in history, poli sci, philosophy, social activism/human rights -- likely to end up going to law school in the future. But this kid of mine really does best in very small classes only (like 20 students or preferably smaller), classes that are entirely or at least heavily class-discussion-based (like sitting around a round table with the prof and other students)(as opposed to lectures), and when close relationships develop with the professor and close relationships with advisors. For that reason, we have only been seriously considering small LAC's. But everything else about Penn would be a great fit, except for the feeling that at least some classes that would need to be taken would be too big, and that there may not be many close relationships with professors and advisors likely to be formed -- this kid is NOT the type to initiate and pursue the relationship, but is more reserved, although is someone who responds and bonds closely with professors and advisors *if* the professors and advisors tend to initiate and at least mildly pursue it. In my attendance at Penn back in the stone ages, I don't recall ever getting a close relationship with any professor ever (nor do I recall any of them seeming to be interested in getting to know me - although I was fine with that and did fine at Penn) and I guess I had an advisor but have no memory of the advisor because similarly I surely didn't develop any real relationship with any advisor either. But reading some of your posts, I wonder if it might be different now, or if it might be different in the history, philosophy, and poly sci departments than it was for me as a psych major (where, as a psych major, I had a few really big classes, although I also did have some very small classes too). I hate giving up the \"legacy\" admissions advantage (which I know is mostly only effective for ED apps, though) -- if our assumption that Penn would be too big, too impersonal for this kid's needs is wrong? Again, Penn would be perfect for this kid in all of the other respects -- it is just the class size and chances (or lack thereof) of easily forming close relationships with professors and advisors (without needing to initiate and pursue the relationships aggressively to form them) that is the knock-out concern.

I don't know when you attended Penn but after Judith Rodin's presidency in the 90s, the College dramatically reduced the average class size, increased faculty, and made the student to faculty ratio more favorable than even Dartmouth's (6:1 compared to Dartmouth's 7:1). She invested a ton in research opportunities specifically for undergraduate students in the humanities and really encouraged professors to include students in their research (by bribing them with lots of money) in a way that really opened the faculty up to the undergraduate population. She and the Deans of the College transformed student advising to the current system in which students are given a peer advisor, a pre major advisor and a College Office advisor before they even set foot on campus. And the Deans of the College have made it a requirement that students in each department are given a specifically designated major advisor from the faculty within the major discipline they declare. You keep all of those advisors throughout your time at Penn and you can turn to any of them at any juncture if you need help making a decision. That may sound pretty standard for liberal arts colleges but students at Columbia don't get a major advisor at all- they're forced to make appointments with a rotating advisory pool. At Penn, you can't even register for classes your first semester (and maybe second semester as well? But I forget) without discussing the classes you chose with your pre-major advisor. Rodin also brought the College House system to Penn which, among other improvements to undergraduate life, ensured that a member of the faculty served as \"House Dean\" for each of Penn's College Houses. Consequently there are often several faculty members living in the College Houses with their families and with all of the undergraduate students. For example, Dean of the College, Dennis DeTurck lives in Riepe and hosts Calculus extra help on Wednesdays in his home within the college house at which he serves cookies to the students who come for his advice. Rodin did many (many many many) other things for the university and the College specifically that I could gush about but these are the major changes she brought that I think have contributed most to making the student experience in the College very different from what pre 1990 alums experienced. The quality of the research and faculties has always been outstanding but Rodin's improvements made those exceptional opportunities more available to undergrads than ever before while fostering a greater sense of community than had been possible at Penn. (Though a Penn grad, Rodin returned to be Penn's president after a career at Yale where should learned a LOT about making undergrad life exceptional. Penn ended up as a hybrid of its former self (urban, high research activity, highly practical and pragmatic, bigger than the average ivy) and the best parts of Yale (residential colleges, strong school identity, an unparalleled emphasis on the liberal arts as a gateway to the other disciplines of academia, full of smaller communities within the context of a larger research university). It often makes me wonder what would have happened if Rodin had come from Harvard, heaven forbid  )\nAll that being said, it's true that Penn will never be as small as Amherst. But I can't think of a single class she would have to take that would be too large if she chooses a major like history or philosophy. Maybe one of the intro classes in Political Science? But I bet there are alternatives. For majors with notoriously large courses, Penn often offers several sections of their most popular classes to ensure that a smaller section is available for students who do best in more intimate classroom environments. The only way to get lost in the crowd at Penn is if you truly want that to be your experience- and make no mistake, it's possible and there are students who seek to be hidden! I bet, however, that's true at Amherst and the LACs too. But if you are *open* to faculty interaction, it will find you even if you don't seek it. If your daughter is the kind of student who raises her hand to participate in a class of 12-19 students, then she'll have no problems building relationships with faculty members. At Penn you will not be forced to interact with faculty if you would prefer to exist in the background. But if you show an interest in your classwork, you can be sure faculty will reach out to you. Two quick anecdotal examples: I once made a comment in a literature class about the political implications of the novel we were reading. When I got home after class I was greeted with an email from my professor who had sent me two articles they felt I should consider reading relating to what we discussed in class. He even invited me to his office to discuss writing a publishable article about the idea and using the historical archives at Penn and in the Library Company of Philadelphia (also founded by Franklin) to access primary sources for the work. He even came with me to the Library Company to check out the documents himself and to ensure I was settled there. All of that just from a comment in class! I had never had the professor before and I hadn't shown any particular interest in the course beyond my peers. I just answered a question in class and he took it from there. And that experience was not unique to me or to that class. Story #2: A comment in another professor's class led her to invite me to office hours to discuss criminal justice reform where she shared information about her own work and an opportunity to become involved in her research. That relationship led to her writing me recommendations for graduate/professional school and we still communicate quite often despite my having graduated a few years back. Penn is not small by any means and it is possible to fade into the crowd if that's what you want. But being shy or introverted or quite is not a recipe for isolation.\nFinally, as someone who was also interested in history/poli sci/human rights/activism and was probably going to end up at law school, I can tell you that Penn was a great fit. The administration goes through a lot of effort to create smaller communities within the class of 2400 (the College only has 1500 per class) that can make Penn feel very close-knit. She won't know everyone in her graduating class, but I was talking to a friend who went to Bowdoin the other day who had no idea he went to college with a friend of mine from high school-- and they have an entering class of about 500! Penn really is what you make of it-- it's worth considering if you think she might like it. Especially given the legacy bump which, you are right, is pretty much exclusively helpful during ED.\nHappy to answer any questions you might have about Penn  ", "user_id": "683881", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}]}, {"topic": "UPenn ED", "url": "https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-pennsylvania/1922650-upenn-ed.html", "comments": [{"date": {"month": "September", "day": "27,", "year": "2016", "time": "9:21AM"}, "comment": "\nI am trying to decide whether I should apply ED to UPenn or not?

It's between my AP Econ teacher and my Honors/AP Bio teacher.\nMy Econ teacher was teaching Econ for the first time, and I managed to get a 5 on one test and a 4 on the other despite some of her deficiencies due to inexperience, which put me in the top handful of students in the class. In addition I was on a team that she coached related to personal finance that got third in the nation, so she really likes me and will probably write a glowing recommendation. I also am applying to Wharton, so the finance and econ are somewhat related to my college aspirations.\nMy Bio teacher is my second favorite teacher throughout highschool to the teacher who I am already getting a rec from. I had her both sophomore and junior years for honors bio and AP Bio, respectfully. In AP Bio I did pretty well, getting As both semesters and a 5 on the test, but in honors bio I made some dumb mistakes and managed to fall into an A- one semester. The information in both classes came to me really easily and she definitely knows that, so she knows I didn't have to try as hard for my scores in AP Bio as the other students who got similar scores, which I know is not a good thing. However I think she still really likes me, and I am president of a club related to Biology that she sponsors. I think she would write me a great letter too, but she could possibly have more negatives to write about me (an A-, and while I did put in effort to her classes, it was less than every other student with As and 5s in my AP Bio class, probably more comparable to students who got in the B+ and 3-4 range). I am also not particularly interested in continuing with Bio for my education. I also know this teacher is one of the most experienced letter writers at my school.\nMy other letter of recommendation is from a history teacher who is also my academic team coach, if that has any effect on which I should go for.

The most characteristic thing about my application is that I took Calculus BC as a sophomore and I'm currently enrolled in Multivariable Calculus at Stanford Online High School. I've taken 7 AP's until now (including this year) - Statistics, Psychology, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Physics C, American Language and US History. I plan to take 5 more my senior year. My GPA is around a 4.3 on a 5-point scale.\nAs for my extra-curriculars, I've been part of Science Olympiad for 6 years and math team for 3. I founded a club and am the president. I have 200 volunteer hours at a local food pantry and also worked a job as a tutor. I also spend time tutoring lower level math students in my school and have a position as a teacher's assistant for Algebra 2 students. I also have experience working with a doctor at University of Chicago.\nI've taken the ACT and gotten a 35. I wanted to know if I should take the SAT or any subject tests as well.

I am just giving you something to think about because you may not have thought about it, and you appear to fit the profile well. Still it depends on your interest. You could also major in econ, math, stats, or computer science in the college, or something else.\nChoosing a school depends on what you want to do with it. If you are interested in Wall Street, you can get there from Wharton, CAS or SEAS. About 20% of CAS students end up in investment jobs and about 25% of SEAS students do too. SEAS students primarily go to work in for areas: the technology, engineering non-tech, consulting, and Investments. It could be worth investigating. One of the advantages of engineering is that it gives you more options. You can interview for investment jobs, but most Wharton students won't be qualified of technology jobs. Many engineering students also eventually add an MBA later to strengthen their business background.\nTransferring into SEAS for CAS students is only difficult for some because they don't have the math and science rigor. SEAS does not want to admit a student if they are not confident the student will succeed. For a student with strong math and science, it is not difficult.

I am a first generation college student. My parents are from israel and I was born the US. My first language was Hebrew so to this day I have an accent and have trouble with English. My school is a dual curriculum school that also includes Jewish and Hebrew classes. I do not take a third language though like others in my school. During my freshman year I was not a good student and had a low gpa of about 3.3. Since then I started to improve my grades. I attend a rigorous private school so it is pretty hard to achieve good scores. I probably have around a 3.5 gpa. The reason why I say around is because we aren't given gpas. I took the sats once and got a 1390; 740 math 650 English. I'm thinking about taking it again to raise my English score. I took calculus at a community college outside of school and received an A. Our school only offers APs in 12th grade and I am taking AP computer science, AP Bio, and AP stat. I tend though not to do as well in English and history class. In English I am modified which is a thing at my school that just acknoledges that the student needs some extra help with the course. I usually end up with Bs in those classes. I have been very hard working over the past few years.\nExtra curricular:\nUpenn internship/shadow/research assistant for 3 years. I worked with cardiovascular doctors and pulmonariologists and was able to watch numberous surgeries, meet with patients, and work on some projects. I built and designed for a thoracic surgeon a prototype 3D hologram that can make organs show up in 3D. (It would be used for lungs) I also was able to help out on a research project that involved treating heart failures with pre operative techniques that can distinguish the groups that will benefit most from one type of surgery than the other. I did this a lot over my 2 summers and during the school year too.\nSchool EC:\nScience in topics club- 10,11,12 co president in 12\nEngineering club -11,12 Vice President in 11 president in 12\nDeca- business club. 11,12.

People with lower math scores get into Wharton every year. And on that note, it's not particularly easier to get into the College either. The difference between Wharton's acceptance rate and that of the College is about the difference between Stanford's and Princeton's (1 or 2 percentage points). Which is to say, applicants are unlikely to be accepted to either and the small difference in acceptance rates doesn't translate into a meaningful difference in the quality of the students accepted. Unless you really think Stanford students are just on a totally different level than Princeton students... But if you do think that then we have more to worry about than your math skills  -- in all seriousness, if Penn is your top choice then you should apply ED. Transferring between the college and wharton isn't 'hard' per se, it's more about having a good reason to do it. I know people with great grades who did not get accepted for the internal transfer because they could not demonstrate that the college wasn't adequately meeting their intellectual needs. Conversely, I had friends with academic records that were not particularly distinguished in any way that were readily accepted to internally transfer. It's a gamble but it's certainly not terribly difficult. That being said, since an applicant is unlikely to be accepted to the College or to Wharton, it makes far more sense to just apply to the school that you believe will best meet your intellectual needs rather than potentially being stuck in a program that doesn't appeal to you given that your qualifications could have probably gotten you into either.\nGood luck-- happy to answer any questions you have about Penn.

And that's true in Engineering as well as the College, Wharton and Nursing (and Penn's graduate/professional schools). Some schools even set aside seats specifically for students from other schools to ensure that they're made available. For example, the law school will often have a certain number of seats reserved for undergrads in courses that are open to them to ensure that students aren't blocked out from accessing them. In all of my time at Penn I don't think I was ever closed out of a class. I do have friends, however, that didn't get their first choice every semester and thus they made alternative selections for that semester and simply signed up for the course they were closed out of the next semester or next year, depending on when it was offered. Plus, if you are locked out of a course that you really want to take, you can talk to the professor about making an exception and adding you to the class if you have a good reason. Between the College and Engineering, it's actually even easier because both schools have opened up their majors to students in the other school, ensuring that kids can double major between schools without having to complete the other school's general education requirements.

Engineers enjoy the same benefits with regard to accessing the whole university's resources as students in the other undergrad schools and the engineering faculty and students are all great. Going to Penn was a truly wonderful decision and I'm grateful every day I made the choice.

Here is my advice:\n1. Get 8 hours of sleep per night.\n2. Eat healthy foods.\n3. Exercise regularly.\n4. Make time for friends and family.\n5. Do the best you can in the most rigorous curriculum available at your high school while still ensuring that steps 1-4 are NEVER compromised.\n6. Do the best you can on the SATs while still ensuring that steps 1-4 are NEVER compromised.\n7. Join as many clubs as you ENJOY and seek out leadership roles within those clubs while ensuring that your involvement in these clubs NEVER compromises steps 1-6.\nAs far as there is a formula, that's it.

They also don't care if you have good grades but you got them at the sacrifice of your health or friendships (that will come across during your interview and in your essays when it becomes glaringly apparent that you didn't spend time cultivating meaningful relationships with your peers or you are doing everything at the expense of your own personal wellbeing). The only thing you need to do is your best while being as healthy and happy with your life as possible. If that puts you in a position to be competitive for admission to Penn at the end of high school then great! With an acceptance rate of about 10%, great applicants who do everything right will still be rejected. So don't try to create the perfect application because it doesn't exist. Instead, focus on being the best you that you can possibly be and let that come across in your applications to Penn and all of the other wonderful schools that exist in this country.\nGood Luck-- stay healthy-- be happy  ", "user_id": "100532435", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}, {"date": {"month": "September", "day": "12,", "year": "2016", "time": "11:42AM"}, "comment": "\nI completely agree with the above post!

So I have a very particular question about the use of calculators at Penn. For reference I'm a sophomore studying Econ in the College.\nI bought a TI-NSpire CX graphing calculator before I came to Penn. I figured it would be useful and thought I would need it throughout my time here. But so far, I haven't had used it a single time. I've taken Math 104/114 + Econ 01/02 and none of these classes have required me to use a calculator. I think Math 104/114 actually forbid the use of graphing calculators in class and exams.\nMy question is essentially this: Will I ever need to use a graphing calculator for the rest of my time here? As in, are there any courses that require you to have a graphing calculator? I'm sure there are professors who would recommend having a graphing calculator as a resource, but I'm specifically asking if I need to have it. I realize this question is specific to myself, but I was hoping to get some insight from Econ majors here (students from other majors are free to chime in too) about whether your class schedules during your time at Penn ever required the use of a graphing calculator. I realize most Econ classes are math-based, but I seriously doubt I'll need to hold on to my TI-NSpire CX. If I find out that it's unnecessary, I will probably just sell it since I spent a good amount of money on it in the first place.\nAnyways, any insight into my inquiry would be much appreciated.

It seems like you might be justifying that other student's rejection by indicating that they didn't have a history of demonstrated interest in Business and thus Wharton wasn't buying their app-- but Penn isn't a place that particularly cares if you've been able to do amazing things in business, science, history, math, etc.- they want to see passion, interest, and curiosity in its raw form so that you can develop it at Penn, no matter what you've done in the past.

The College's acceptance rate is always, nearly exactly the same as the overall school acceptance rate because it makes up the largest contingent of the undergraduate student body and thus has a disproportionately larger affect on the weighted overall admit rate. for example, in the article below from the DP in 2003, the College's admit rate was 19.4%, Wharton's was 15.5%, SEAS was 28.1%, Nursing's was 42.6% and yet the overall admit rate was 20.5%. If the schools were all averaged together equally, the overall admit rate would have been higher. Alternatively, if the overall admit rate was just the average of the ED and RD admit rate, then the RD admit rate back in 2003 would have had to be about 8% (which it wasn't), in order for the overall rate to be 20.5 But because each school's admit rate is weighted, the rate most closely mirrors that of the College. So you can assume that the College's admit rate is about 9-10%, Wharton and engineering are a bit lower (probably 8-9%), and Nursing is usually higher (probably 15-16%). As you can see in both the 2003 article and this article from 2010 showing the nursing admit rate to be about 20% while the overall admit rate was 14.2%, penn nursing tends to be about 5-6% points higher than the overall.http://www.thedp.com/index.php/article/2003/04/admission_rates_drop_at_penn_ivieshttp://www.thedp.com/article/2010/02/decisions_sent_to_nursing_hopefulshttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/31/penn-acceptance-rate-fall_n_519942.html ", "user_id": "684760", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}, {"date": {"month": "August", "day": "27,", "year": "2016", "time": "3:54PM"}, "comment": "\nThere were a total of 9,143 freshman SEAS applications to the Class of 2020 for 410 spaces.\nIf I remember correctly, there were just over 770 SEAS acceptances offered to the class of 2019.

Academic ability is probably pretty evenly distributed across the undergraduate population. Just as an example, you can compare the SAT scores of the overall incoming class at Penn to that of the class entering just the school of engineering. At the time of my writing this post, the links below show data for the class of 2019:\nOverall Stats: -- Engineering Specific Stats\nCR: 690 - 780 -- Engineering CR: 640 -750\nMath: 710-800 -- Engineering Math: 680 - 780\nWriting: 700 - 790 -- Engineering Writing: 650 - 750http://www.admissions.upenn.edu/apply/whatpennlooksfor/incoming-class-profilehttps://www.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/undergrad/\nAs you can see, Engineering students tend to have lower standardized test scores across the three sections. Of course, the SATs are only one indicator of academic ability but I think this speaks to the overall reality that Penn students across its undergraduate schools are pretty evenly intelligent and differ only in their areas of academic interest -- and each person is valued for whatever their contribution might be!\nAlso I don't know that it's harder to get into Wharton than Engineering-- i think both attract very specific students who are all extremely well qualified and competing for a limited number of places among other very qualified applicants. And once in the schools, you really don't see a lot of transferring so it is unlikely that it is harder to stay in Engineering for an engineer or easier to stay in Wharton for a whartonite-- they've each attracted students well suited to the type of work they're doing and for students with those interests and abilities sharing a classroom with other students who are equally interested and able is probably equally difficult.

You'll find that a great majority of students at Penn either chose to apply ED because it was their absolute top choice and they didn't care to find out if they got into Stanford because they didn't want to go-- and many others chose it during the RD round over equally wonderful schools as well. I personally chose Penn over Yale and Columbia among other schools and I certainly wasn't alone. My roommate chose Penn over Columbia and Brown to study biology. One of the girls across the hall chose Penn over Harvard and Princeton to study classics. Another boy down the hall chose Penn over Yale and Cornell to study engineering. The point I'm trying to make is that all of Penn's four schools are full of incredibly bright, interesting, and unique people. Broad generalizations about any of Penn's four schools in 2016 don't make a lot of sense. They were more appropriate back in the mid 20th century when Penn was a very, very different place. Today, however, student/faculty quality is pretty incredible across the board.
