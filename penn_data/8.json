In total legacies are about 1 in 8 I think.@f2000sa that makes sense.

The overall rate around 8.5%\n\n\nThis year they admitted slightly fewer people than usual ED. I am not sure if they plan to keep the proportion of the class admitted ED stable and thus admit an overall smaller class or simply admit a slightly higher percentage of the class RD and retain the same target class size as last year.\nIf it is the first scenario, the target total class size would be 2385 and the acceptance rate would be 8.2%. They would need to admit 2334 RD applicants. -- (2385-1312*98.7%)/46.7% = 2334\nThis is assuming that the ED admit/target class size number stays at ~55%, as it has in recent years and also that the ED yield and RD yield remain the same as last year, i.e. 98.7% (1336/1354) and 46.7% (1121/2403). (The # of ED admits who actually enrolled last year can be found in the CDS). The yields could be actually a bit higher since there was a slight dip last year compared to the previous few years.\nIf it is the second scenario, the target total class size would be 2445 like last year and the acceptance rate would be around 8.5%.They would need to admit 2463 RD applicants. --(2445 - 1312*98.7%)/46.7% = 2463\nAgain assuming the yields remain the same.\nIn any case most likely the acceptance rate will be in the 8-8.5% range unless there is a significant change in yield.

If Wharton is you're #1 school, apply ED/EA this gives you a higher chance and shows your interest more than RD.\nI asked about alternate EC's because like many highly competitive schools, they like to see diversity and leadership within those EC's. Not that I think you do, but having only volunteering or only clubs with no leadership or higher positions, doesn't show depth. It would appear that you are just minimally involved and doing it just for your transcript.\nAlso showing interest in your chosen major whether it be through internships (like the ones you are trying to purse), or EC's lets admissions know why you are passionate about business, and why you would like to pursue it. Being that Wharton is one of the most prestigious business schools around, I'm sure they would care to know why you are applying there.\nThat being said, you still have time to achieve many things and show personal/academic growth, for now I think you stand a pretty good chance.

I can't remember the sources, but I've read a few times in the past year or so that legacy admits have same stats as general admit population, but athletic recruits do have lower stats. This is also what I see in my dds' big public school. Every year our public school sends several athletes (mostly for crew) to the ivies who are solid students but not top 5% or even 10% and with SAT/ACT scores in the bottom quartile of their respective ivies.\nThe legacy admits are always top of their hs class. I think legacy kids are given a leg up when they are competing against other candidates with roughly same stats and accomplishments. This is not an insignificant advantage considering the ivies-plus schools reject hundreds if not thousands of extremely accomplished candidates every year.\nOn a side note, I was a little shocked to read about how quickly some 1st-gen/low-income students at Penn become interested in passing on their legacy status to their own yet unborn children.

In any event, felt compelled to chime in here.\nAdvantage for legacy applicants in the admissions process is going absolutely nowhere and money is the reason. Penn and other elite private institutions have been playgrounds for the wealthy and well-connected since their beginning, which is why they are \"elite\" at all. An ongoing relationship with wealthy alumni and those with social clout helps the school brand and influence while providing it with material resources. What will happen, however, is that legacy advantage will increasingly only be conferred to applicants who apply early and whose parents donate higher and higher amounts of money, since the alumni base has only grown and diversified with time. As a recent alumni, I fully anticipate that my children will receive no leg up from my attending Penn simply because I will in all likelihood not have donated enough to the university in sum (though I do stay involved with the university in different ways).\nThat said, other hooks won't disappear either: first-gen status, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, state of residency (for under-represented states), athletics, etc. The biggest issue at Penn and schools like it is that the first two hooks in the list immediate before this aren't leveraged nearly enough (certainly not comparable to the amount of time schools spend touting them), nor are all the necessary support mechanisms in place to actually support these students and their success once the arrive on campus (and it's only becomes more complicated when you also must account for race, ethnicity or religious affiliation) given they may likely be starting from behind in comparison to their classmates despite their intelligence or work ethic. Resources matter, and they matter from the first moment children enter a classroom in their lives. American universities, no matter how elite, can't necessarily fix that, but they can do more in than they are doing when it comes to fostering development and success for everyone who sets foot on their campus.

(i\u2019m not sure of this)\nI can take some courses at Booth Business School\nAgainst-\nIt\u2019s waaaay more difficult to be admitted (1 person/ in a 180class) and to be completely admitted there\u2019s a need to do a Math Acceptation Exam? (yet this would not be a total complication because i still have time, i\u2019m on my 1st year)\nIts not an Ivy League and UChicago \u201cbrand name\u201d for the CV would be less useful? (not sure of this)\nUPenn\nPros-\nIt is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted (my university offer 4 exchanges)\nIt\u2019s an Ivy, and meanwhile in Economics may be worst in Business it\u2019s completely better (if i\u2019m going to work in Business field maybe this helps?)\nThis is more subjective, but i value more taking classes in an Ivy! (But i admit this is biased and based on \u201cmarketing\u201d i\u2019m not utterly sure if some of the Ivies are kind of \u201coverrated\u201d)\nAgainst\nThis is a 6 month instance??? So i don\u2019t know if a semester is a full course or i would graduate in more years (4,5 instead of only 4)\nI CAN\u2019T take courses from Wharton Business School, and i believe this is a huge issue\nThereby, what would be the best option? I know both are great universities but yet i\u2019m not sure what would be the \u201cmost efficient\u201d choice\nThe last thing i add, i\u2019m a student in some sort of budget and i have understood Chicago it\u2019s cheaper, but then again, i willingly would make some sort of sacrifice to attend Penn if is the best option!\nThank you!

That\u2019s not a good idea. Most people become economists. You should study finance if you want to work in finance or financial economics or minor in finance. Look up the financial risk management certificate. Although there\u2019s emphasis on economics and math, you won\u2019t pick up on enough finance in an Econ program.\nHowever, people do go into finance. Usually risk management, did my undergraduate internships in risk management. They like to see lots of math and finance courses.

The economics department at both schools are excellent. As you point out, there is no undergraduate business degree at UChicago. But I believe that only the UChicago undergrads who are in special program can take Booth classes. Not sure how it works at Wharton.\nUChicago is very heavily weighted towards reading/writing. Your knowledge of the English language will definitely make it more difficult for you. Many of the assignments are heavily based on critical reading and writing. You'll see very few multiple choice tests. Even students whose first language is English often struggle with putting together coherent essays and arguments for class assignments.

The annual fundraising performance barely scratches the surface in terms of her performance. Just off the top of my head I can think of several things:\n1. She lead the largest capital campaign in Penn history\n2. Secured a $200+ million donation for the medical school\n3. Launched the PIK professors program through which Penn has \"poached\" top professors from many other elite universities.\n4. Started the all-grant no loan FA policy\n5. Her Penn Compact has integrated the different schools and strengths of the university much more and has sparked a lot of innovation. Penn is the pioneer and leader in gene therapy, for example.\n6.

Such small changes are of no practical importance at his level. Once you enter the top 10 it doesn't matter. HYPSM are always gonna be the tippy top in terms of overall prestige unless something seismic happens. As for Harvard and Stanford, well these two are the undisputed top dogs of higher ed, they are just on a different level by pretty much all metrics. And that is fine.

Shouldn't improvement be what's most heavily coveted, not maintenance?\nWhy is Gutmann's pay 2X more than some of these other presidents?

It might mean that the money will go further because of the smaller student body, but even that depends on how you manage it. However, looking at how fundraising works, it is clear that having a bigger student body size doesn't make it any easier to raise big sums. If anything I find Penn's fundraising performance much more impressive than Yale's given that Yale has a stronger brand and the best CIO out there, which both should actually make it quite easier to attract big-time donations.\nre maintaining the status quo, I think she is doing anything but that. My comment about maintaining was regarding Penn's overall perceived prestige, which as I mentioned, is extremely difficult to change noticeably when you are near the very top. The next step for Penn would be to be considered as prestigious as HYPSM, which is an extremely hard ceiling to crack even if real progress is being made. As I said, something seismic would need to happen in order for Penn or any other non-HYPSM elite school to achieve that.\nIn the meantime, her accomplishments do show that Penn has been improving a lot. In terms of innovation and entrepreneurship Penn is also been steadily improving and is close to the very top. Penn this year was the pioneer for the biggest cancer breakthrough in recent times. It was also the pioneer for the first gene therapy treatment approved in the US. It recruited Biden and just opened a brand new policy center in DC. Number of apps are consistently increasing, yield has increased since she took office, financial aid budget is increasing every year, endowment is the 5th biggest after HYPSM and has performed extremely well in the past 10 years (Ammon was appointed by Gutman and is a Swensen protege). The campus has been completely transformed, in a scale much larger than at any of the other schools which have similar resources. Yes Harvard has bought up all of Allston, but it also has over 3x the endowment that Penn has. PIK has recruited some of the worlds top scholars from places like Harvard, Duke, NU amongst others.\nAny way you slice it Penn has been making real progress and most of it is due to her leadership. All schools have a host of initiatives but if you look closely no other president of peer schools have had the kind of comprehensive and long-term impact Gutmann has had on Penn . There hasn't been a president that has done so much with comparable resources. I think the amount and impact of what she has done given the resources available is something unique and worth her salary. She is extremely well-regarded in higher ed and fundraising circles for her work at Penn. Besides, I dont think the Board of Trustees are not smart enough to be paying her what she deserves. Most of her compensation is tied to milestones which she clearly hits.\nRodin was an incredibly difficult act to follow by any standards. I don't think there has been a more effective college president in recent memory. But Gutmann has held her own and done some really amazing things.

Penn is considered one of the 4-5 schools that are a notch below HYPSM. While real changes and improvements are happening, getting to the next tier is almost impossible, you would need something seismic to happen as i said. No marketing campaign, clever admissions strategy, climbing rankings etc can achieve that. One way for Penn to get to the next level would be to take advantage of its status as the pioneer in gene therapy and immuno-oncology, somehow build a biotech ecosystem that can rival Boston and SF and then have amazon pick Philadelphia for its HQ2 and harness Amazons presence for more breakthroughs and national/international exposure. Something of this scale needs to happen organically in order for Penns standing to increase substantially. This would be similar to what propelled Stanford to be Harvard's rival nowadays and surpass Yale and Princeton. At the level Penn is at, maintaining its spot is a very hard and demanding job that i think Gutmann has been doing very well.\nRegarding why she gets paid more, I think just looking at fundraising means looking at only part of the picture. Yes fundraising is important but what you do with that money is also extremely important. I stand by my assessment that there is no president of a university with similar resources and standing that has done more with the resources available than Gutmann.

I don't think UPenn has done more than Columbia, Chicago, Hopkins, Northwestern, and certainly not Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, with the money it's raised.\nYou look at any of the roughly top ten research Us, and they are all doing a tremendous amount of building, of core investment, and of fundraising. If you look at where Penn comes out in almost any metric here - it's firmly in the bottom half of the top 10-12 schools.\n\n\nAbsolutely disagree. I do think Penn has done more with the money it has raised and its existing endowment than other schools, especially Harvard, Stanford, Yale ( and even more so Yale) which are all tremendously richer schools than Penn. In terms of campus building this is definitely true and easy to see when comparing Penn to the schools with similar resources (i.e. leaving HS out). If you go to the Penn facilities website and compare the scale of building and renovations, Penn's is much more extensive and comprehensive. Some goes for all he other initiatives I outlined above. I haven't seen a school with comparable resources that has done so much in so many different fronts over the last couple decades.\nPenn does not come out in on the bottom half of the 10-12 by almost any metric regarding new initiatives, tangible impact etc, far from it if you adjust for the resources and standing of the school. Also Bollinger has done a lot but has definitely not done better than Gutmann. Even a quick review of their respective wiki pages makes that obvious, and it is confirmed if you dig deeper. The only president that overall has done just as well as Gutmann was probably Hennessy at Stanford. However, Stanford's strength and standing was and is at a different level than Penn's to begin with and I also suspect that presidency positions at Harvard and Stanford are not as well paid as at other elite universities because these two are the most prestigious presidential positions there are. There is less need to pay huge salaries to keep top talent from leaving for other universities and top foundations. Schools like Penn has to pay top dollar to retain top talent (Harvard actively tried to recruit Gutmann for president a few years back and also before she became president at Penn).\nAs i said before I think Penn pays Gutmann significantly more because she has one extraordinary things with the ordinary (by tippy top school standards) recourses and standing that Penn has and has been consistent in doing that for almost 14 years now. Also Penn knows they have struck gold and that Gutmann is so sought-after that she could get a presidential university or top foundation in a heartbeat so they need to keep the incentives going. The board of trustees is comprised of some seriously smart people, I dont really doubt they are overpaying her.\nBtw i think you might find this interesting. https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/02/04/amy-gutmann-penn-trump/ ", "user_id": "100374735", "user_name": "Penn95 ", "user_thread_count": "79", "user_comment_count": "2283"}, {"date": {"month": "February", "day": "19,", "year": "2018", "time": "8:53PM"}, "comment": "\n@Penn95 - being in the bottom half of the top 10-12 would, be, well, finishing #6 or #7 (or lower). How did UPenn finish in fundraising according to this article - #7, no? That's in the bottom half of the top 10 (or 12).\nYou're a big Gutmann fan, but let's look at some numbers - UPenn, Columbia, and UChicago all pay their presidents roughly the same amount - about $3M a year. Meanwhile, Harvard paid out $1.5M, Hopkins $1.3M, Northwestern $1.5M, Stanford $1.2M, Yale $1.1M, Duke $1.2M, Brown $1.1M, and on and on...\nYou think the UPenn president deserves almost 3X what Duke or Hopkins or Stanford's presidents make?\nAlso, Penn's fundraising has been good, but when you point to endowment growth, the key exec there is the manager of the endowment. That's who rakes in big bucks for great endowment performance - it has less to do with the president.\nI'm not saying Penn isn't doing well. BUT, we are in the era of thriving urban research Us - and many of them are doing well. To say Penn's pace is 3X Hopkins' or Duke's is silly to me.\nFinally, you touch on the most salient point briefly - much of compensation is based on institutional fear. It's no surprise who the top schools paying the most are - Chicago, UPenn, and Columbia. These schools have had the same leader for quite some time, and these schools are also in the most uncertain positions - knocking on the door of the tippy top, but also competing quite ferociously against each other (and others).\nSo, the compensation, then, might not purely be a reflection of institutional progress - but, rather, institutional fear.\nThere's a difference.\nSource: https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/executive-compensation ", "user_id": "100374735", "user_name": "Cue7 ", "user_thread_count": "119", "user_comment_count": "2724"}, {"date": {"month": "February", "day": "20,", "year": "2018", "time": "6:13PM"}, "comment": "\n\nAlso, Penn's fundraising has been good, but when you point to endowment growth, the key exec there is the manager of the endowment. That's who rakes in big bucks for great endowment performance - it has less to do with the president.\n\n\nThe money manager was a Gutmann appointee. All Swensen proteges are hot commodities and super tough to get. Same goes for the dean of admissions who had a very impressive track record at Columbia before coming to Penn. She has been very good at appointing the right people in the right positions. Yes i think the pace of Penn compared to Duke or Hopkins is quite higher in terms of new initiative and progress in multiple different fronts, difficult do quantify how much though. Just as example, look at how many star professors and researchers Penn poached from Duke through the PIK program, it is around 3-4 I think. They even managed to poach 2-3 major stars from Harvard. or the new partnership with novartis that yielded the biggest cancer breakthrough of the last decade or so. This is all Gutmann's doing.\nI get the point about institutional fear, but in order for an institution to have something major to fear they must have something really valuable to lose. And Gutmann is that for Penn. She is by no means perfect but vis a vis her contemporaries she has had the most tangible impact and has done the most given Penn's resources and standing. I think it is pretty smart of penn to be paying her what they are.

Here is what I can remember about the KWH recruitment process:\nI sent an email to Jamie-Lee introducing myself and asking whether I could come visit. She responded enthusiastically and said that I can stop by anytime. We set up a meeting time.\nA few months later I visit the campus and stop by the KWH. Jamie-Lee and I had a very informal chat for around 30 minutes, talking about Penn in general, the KWH, and my interest in writing. I brought samples of work to show her (1 or 2 short stories, 1 or 2 articles I published, and maybe a poem). I gave her my writing so she could put in my file or something like that.\nI think I may have also sent her digital copies of my work which is definitely the better way to go because I am sure Jamie-Lee receives hundreds of emails and writing samples.\nI kept in contact every few months with a random email.\nThe summer between junior year and senior year came along and I received an email telling me about a book discussion for prospective KWH \"recruits.\" I joined and it was maybe a month long online book discussion where we excepts of books written by Penn professors I think. Probably 10-100 other people participated, with maybe 40 or 50 being active. It was a great book group and we had a lot of insightful comments to say to one another about the reading.\nPerhaps participation and quality of comments were analyzed by Jamie-Lee and any other moderator of the discussion. I'm sure it had some impact on our recruitment.\nAfter the book group we were sent a questionnaire to fill out about ourselves and our interest in Penn, the KWH, and writing. I got an email saying \"If you are receiving this message, you are on our list of prospective students for the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Class of 2021. As you know, we at the Kelly Writers House care a great deal about recruiting strong writers to the Penn community. I\u2019m writing now to ask you to complete a brief survey which will help us understand your interest in Penn as it relates to our program.\"\nIt was probably August or September by now so senior year was just starting. I didn't hear anything from Jamie-Lee for a month or two so I emailed her. She said that she had made sure Admissions knows the KWH had been in touch and that the KWH feels \"strongly about my candidacy.\" I ended up being deferred and then ultimately rejected, but whatever lol. I think part of the reason why I wasn't accepted was because I applied to Wharton, and even though Penn welcomes interdisciplinary students it didn't make total sense for me to get recruited as a writer but apply to the business school.\nJamie-Lee does a fantastic job keeping the process informal, but at the same time it was also stressful because you know that being \"recruited\" helps your application.

I applied ED to Wharton, got deferred and then eventually rejected with the support of the KWH throughout the whole process. I sent writing samples, met with Jamie-Lee in person, participated in the summer online book discussion, and filled out the recruiting survey. I didn't hear anything from her so I eventually emailed her before ED decisions came out to see if my application was supported. She replied and said that she was supporting my candidacy. I know Wharton is difficult to get into but I think my application was very competitive so my take on the whole situation is that there are so many students who now know about the KWH that the support of an application does not help too much. At first I thought it didn't help me because I applied to Wharton so I thought an admissions officer must have questioned why I was interested in writing but wanted to study business. Then I remembered reading something or having someone tell me that the KWH liked supporting applicants who were not pure English majors because of diversification purposes. My opinion is, regardless if you are applying to the College or Wharton or SEAS or Nursing, the support of KWH does not help a great deal simply because I believe there are many applicants who are in contact with the KWH. I seem to remember reading somewhere that around 200-300 applicants are supported each year, and that information is several years old meaning those numbers could even be higher. The support might push an application from the rejected pile to the deferred (perhaps like it did to mine), push a rejected to an accepted, or keep a rejected where it is. I think the support level varies because I think there are a select few candidates whose application gets supported more heavily than others.\nMy advice is to email Jamie-Lee individually and ask politely whether or not the KWH has been in contact with Admissions about your application.

If you love English you should DEFINITELY keep it; there are so many diverse English classes here with great professors, and they'll give you a good GPA boost to balance out some of the BBB classes.\nPenn is /extremely/ social, but not in an overwhelming way. I was sort of introverted in high school and preferred to make close-knit friendships, so I didn't quite want to go somewhere where the culture was \"going out three times a week with people you don't really like.\" I usually go out once or twice a week, and most of the time when I do it's not a huge frat party but one of my friends having people over in their apartment. That being said, I know kids who do go to frat parties three times a week (the weekend can start on Thursday night IF you don't have a morning Friday class), if that's more your thing. Right now I'd say I probably have six people I can trust with anything and talk to all day, and at least a dozen others I willingly hang out with one-on-one.\nThe biggest negative for me has been the intro STEM classes and culture around them, which is also why I emphasize keeping an English major if you love it. They're designed to weed out pre-med students who might not have the proper skill set to be a doctor. If you want to be a doctor and do well in those classes, great! If you want to be a doctor but your grades are struggling, you figure that out BEFORE med school. If you're academic like me, you have to suffer through a semester or two of subpar grades that don't test your knowledge. My bio professor told me last week \"In bio 101, the best doctors get A's. The best scientists get C's.\" It's tough to get over the fact that a C =/= a failure, which is why I advise talking to your professors and to IGNORE THE OTHER KIDS. Everyone wants to put on a front that they're the smartest kid there, but nobody's good at everything.@RGEJam Penn has worked hard to establish the reputation of being the most LGBT-friendly school in the United States, and one of the ways they've done that is by actively recruiting LGBT students, hence the question. It obviously won't be a golden ticket in, but it's a different way of showing the diversity of the student body. I also received an email after my acceptance from someone in the Queer Student Alliance, so the question is just as much a hook as it is a way of connecting you to the community.

They try to make up for the impersonal nature of these large lectures via recitations and labs, which have about 20-24 kids in them, but even in recitation there isn't a good chance for you to show your knowledge (it's mostly doing an experiment, going over problem sets, and asking questions; not so much educated discussion), so the only measure of your intelligence is your grades, which again are designed for people who learn a very specific way. Even if you tell yourself that you can be successful with a first-semester C, it's hard to cancel out the noise of ~200 kids saying differently. I've also noticed that the sciences are filled more with kids who aggressively hide any indication that they might not be perfect or that they have to study to do well, whereas the humanities are more willing to admit \"I haven't slept in 3 days, my dinner is coffee and potato chips, and I have no memory of writing the essay I just turned in.\" Humanities students and academic STEM kids tend to be more approachable than pre-meds.\nI don't know any pre-med students not majoring in a science. Med schools, from what upperclassmen have told me, tend to care about grades and course load, and it's very hard to get all your med school requirements in without a science major -- even if you could do it, at that point you would have so many credits towards the major that you might as well declare it. Within the sciences bio is the most popular pre-med major, with BBB as the runner-up that some take because it's more fun (and 1.5x the credit requirements, so keep that in mind) and occasionally chemistry.

If you are thinking of doing pre-med, you will have to deal with them. If you want to do any kind of natural science they'll be there too.\nIf spending four years with kids who are willing to claw each other's eyes out over an A doesn't sound very appealing to you, and you want to be a doctor due to an interest in biology/medicine and not explicitly to help the sick and injured hands-on, I would suggest going into academia. You can major in biology, BBB, or chemistry with an academic intention and work a research job like I do (you'll still have pre-meds in your classes but you can consider them more in your periphery because they're not your grad school competition), or you can major in Health and Societies like I said above, which is more of a humanities-style major but still talks about heath and medicine for those interested.\nTl;dr just know what you're getting into and consider your options now, or in a semester, or a year.

That being said, it happens more often in science classes due to the nature of the classes. In STEM you either get the right answer or the wrong answer, and while partial credit exists it's based on a strict rubric. Humanities are graded more on a combination of factors.\nIn my current courseload:\nIntro to Brain and Behavior - two midterms with mean 77.5 and 80. If mean is below an 80, points are added so the mean becomes an 80; no downward curve if mean is >80.\nIntroductory Biology A - three midterms with means 60, 72, and 68.

There's a seminar once a year for all the TAs across sciences and engineering to go over protocols, standards, etc. and at one point the professor leading the room full of TAs puts an English prompt up on the projector. He asks us to think it over and to come up with a 10-point grading scale. As he starts to flip through a couple sample responses, the room laughs \u2014 of course, trying to grade a humanities assignment is purely subjective, right? He asks a couple people in the room what they gave as grades and everyone is giving wildly different scores.\nThen he moves on to a simple physics problem (mass * acceleration = force) followed by four sample responses:\nCorrectly solved using the right formula and without any errors\nIncorrectly solved using the right formula but with a minor arithmetic error that leads to the wrong numeric answer\nIncorrectly solved using the wrong formula but by dumb luck getting the correct numeric answer at the end\nIncorrectly solved using the wrong formula and wrong numeric answer at the end\n\nHe starts asking random people what they graded and to our surprise, people are still giving wildly different scores, which you might think is odd since it's really just a math problem.\nWell, someone raises their hand and says that he graded the four responses as follows: 10/10, 0/10, 10/10, 0/10.

Imagine if that was a doctor applying the wrong dosage to a patient or imagine an engineer designing an airplane with an incorrect calculation.

Penn doesn't have a general neuroscience major, but you can concentrate in neurobiology within the biology minor, and the difference is that the neurobiology concentration is going to be more clinical, focused on the mechanics of the brain and nervous system.

I haven't been to all the others yet, so I can't give superlatives, but Penn is objectively social IN A GOOD WAY.\nI was concerned that it might be too social (as in, packs of people going out and partying three nights a week), and that definitely exists, but you can opt out if that's not your thing. For me, most of my social life is an older friend with an apartment or house saying \"hey come over, the Flyers game is on/I made food/I want to hang out\". This past weekend, I went to a friend's frat on Friday, went to a band event on Saturday where I made brunch plans for Sunday morning, and Sunday night I knocked on my friend's door and we chatted until midnight.\nDepending on where you live, you might have to put different levels of effort into getting integrated into the social scene. If you live in Hill or the Quad you'll automatically link up with people from your hall. Suites you're friends with your suitemates. If you live in a single like me, you'll find friends through clubs -- the band was a big one for me, so is the radio station.\nFinally, the summer before matriculation there will be a lot of Facebook posts about \"who's in this major\", \"who wants to go to this concert,\" etc, which can be a good way to go in there feeling like at least you know SOMEONE. I friended 3-ish people from Facebook group conversations over the summer, and one of them is now my Suffer Buddy because we always have our hardest classes together.

The program only takes ~45 people each year. Just a bit of relevant background for my questions: I am a UPenn legacy, scholarship money is very important to my family (unable to afford the insane $50k+ of some top universities even though large annual income due to health and familial reasons), and I am a California resident (was international, but no longer).\nPlease keep in mind that I am aware Penn, M&T, and Stanford are highly selective programs with low chances of acceptance. It is only because these are the only \"reach\" schools that I am considering applying that I would like to clarify things on the off chance that I am accepted to any of the aforementioned programs/schools.\nMy ranking of the programs I am thinking of are: 1) M&T program 2) Stanford 3) Penn single degree\nHere is my current situation.\nI know ED for any program, single or dual degree is binding for Penn, and my best shot especially at a program like M&T is ED due to legacy status AND due to the fact that ED is slightly easier, so I've heard, at M&T. However, this ED decision may potentially damage the amount of scholarship money I receive as I am obligated to go on the off chance I am accepted (regardless of money). In that situation, it may potentially be better to apply to M&T in the RD round, where I could compare acceptances and/or scholarships received.\nThe second thing I want to bring up is that M&T is my dream program, the #1 program on my list for a number of reasons relating to engineering + business prowess/job opportunities. However, Penn has this application guideline that allows you to choose a single backup degree if you are not accepted into M&T so they can review again for admission. However, if that is the case, the backup program would be ranked a tiny bit lower (although still one of the top!) below Stanford, which is amazing for engineering as well as business.\nI would have to specify on the M&T application whether or not I would consider this single backup degree as an alternative for a binding acceptance. Considering the Stanford placement above this single degree, this makes for an interesting dilemma. Essentially, how do I proceed with applications then?\n- Do I apply M&T ED and place my Penn single degree application into RD so if I am rejected from M&T I can apply without binding to Stanford (second choice)? (keep in mind I would lose legacy status and there is a big chance of not being accepted to Stanford).\n- Do I apply M&T and Penn single degree both ED so I keep legacy status? (but lose the opportunity of being able to apply to Stanford (second choice) for potential acceptance).\n- Do I apply Stanford EA, given that it is non-binding and would open my options, but lose the opportunity at M&T (top choice) and Penn single degree (third choice)? (but more scholarship opportunities and perhaps Benjamin Franklin Scholar which is open to RD only)\nWith that in mind:\n1) What do you suggest out of the three options I have stated above? Why?\n2) Is there any way to be considered for Benjamin Franklin Scholar/any other scholar programs with ED M&T? I've heard that they are only geared towards RD students to convince them to come to Penn.\n3) Is there a way to negotiate scholarships with ED results? For example, with RD if you get a higher scholarship from another school, sometimes they will match it. But with ED, if I am unable to afford it, what happens?\nThank you!

I can't confirm my enrollment until I find out if I can actually afford to attend, so this is pretty important.\nI'm going to call later in the week to ask about it, but I was wondering if this is a normal thing that everyone else is going through or if I'm the only person who doesn't have their financial aid report back?
