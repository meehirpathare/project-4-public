As mentioned by others above, Penn CAS does not offer a business major. That said, there are many students in CAS who major in various things such as Econ, PPE, Politics,IR who then go on to top business jobs after graduation. Also CAS students can take as many wharton classes as they can fit in their schedule and take full advantage of all the Wharton business-related student organizations and recruiting resources.\n2. Penn is a reach for almost anyone, regardless the specific school. If you feel that you are not competitive enough to even have a decent chance at Wharton, then your chances at Penn CAS are not that much better either. Wharton might be a bit harder to get in, but the difference is not big. You should think of it as the difference between Harvard/Stanford vs Yale/Princeton. On the margin, it is a bit tougher to get into the former, but you still need to be well within the competitive admissions range for the former to have a decent chance in the latter.\nMy advice is to apply to the school that best fits your academic and professional interests.

I have a couple of questions:\n1. Do I need a strong science background for M and T? I go to a well known prep school and have a very strong math background (AIME, Calc BC 5, SAT Math II 800, etc.), but because of the way I chose my courses, I haven't taken many science courses, especially ones that are math heavy. If I get into M and T, I'd choose comp sci as my \"engineering\" major (and even for that, I've only taken one CS course, which was only an intro and not AP). On the flip side, I've taken extensive courses in economics and finance, and have business experience.\nI did see an individualized option for the engineering major- what does that mean?\n2. I heard Penn students are very career oriented, so will I still be able to have those deep, intellectual, and theoretical conversations that happen elsewhere (or at least advertised elsewhere)?\n3. As an add on, I'm a more introverted person. I don't do well in crowds, but can be pretty outgoing with small groups. I'm not shy, but I don't plan on going to parties and clubbing; instead I'd prefer to hang out with my core group of friends and do something fun. Will it be easy to meet people like me, given the size of Penn? Is there a sizable group of introverts at Penn?\n4. Are there resources and support for starting your own company at Wharton?\nThanks in advance!

For M&T you need a strong math and/or science background. Since you have a strong math background you will be fine. No one expects you to be an expert in CS before entering college.\nThe individualized option means you can build your own major according to your interests.\n2. Penn has a very strong preprofessional element, but it also has many outlets for the intellectually oriented students.\nFor example:http://www.philomathean.org/about/\n3. You don't have to party or go crazy at Penn. Many people do not. Penn's social life is mainly organized through student clubs and organizations. Secs are a huge part of the Penn experience both in providing students with practical experience in their fields of interest and providing smaller communities with the larger Penn community.

Princeton, for instance, is still more or less a liberal arts college at the undergrad level. Penn and Cornell HAVE liberal arts colleges, but they are just components in much larger undergrad environments.\nIf you just want \"classic\" undergrad liberal arts majors - without the \"noise\" of more practical pursuits, Princeton is the better option.

Also you can double major very easily within the same school, do a minor or more, and take classes in any school across the entire university. Anyone can take classes across different colleges and even graduate schools. Also you can do research at a school that is different than your home school. Also in general it is easy to switch majors and also switch schools within Penn. Switching internally into Wharton is a bit tougher because there is more demand, but if you have a 3.5+GPA and a demonstrated interest in business then it is not that hard.\nThe acceptance difficulty for most of the dual degree programs is higher than the already high difficulty of getting into Penn in general.

Penn is committed to meeting 100% of the demonstrated financial need of all eligible dependent undergraduate students \u2013 a commitment that has resulted in more than $1 billion in undergraduate financial aid being awarded since 2008.\nWe understand that clarification regarding the policy on providing eight academic semesters of grant aid support may be needed:\n1) The grant-based financial aid program was created by President Gutmann in 2008. Since 2008, the policy has consisted of grant aid combined with work-study for a total of eight undergraduate academic semesters.\n2) The program and the eight-academic semester policy is outlined on the Undergraduate Admissions website, Student Financial Services (SFS) website as well as in information mailed to incoming students.\n3) Among the aided undergraduate student population, the overwhelming majority complete their undergraduate degrees within eight academic semesters.\n4) SFS has always exercised discretion in the review of grant-based funding eligibility for students with disabilities, high need students, and students with health challenges. This includes consideration of grant-based funding that may exceed eight semesters.\nPenn\u2019s academic and administrative leadership supports this policy, which meets Dr. Gutmann\u2019s 2008 University initiative and is consistent with our Ivy peers.\nAny questions about the policy should be directed to MaryFrances McCourt, [email\u00a0protected]\nMaryFrances McCourt, Vice President for Finance and Treasurer\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\" ", "user_id": "217478", "user_name": "connections ", "user_thread_count": "9", "user_comment_count": "1318"}, {"date": {"month": "July", "day": "25,", "year": "2017", "time": "10:30AM"}, "comment": "\nIn my opinion, the issue is not their policy.

No need to stress.\nI'll take your word for it regarding the fall 2017 graduation requirements. If there is no double counting or reduced requirements, that raises the question of why do a coordinate dual degree vs an uncoordinated one. I thought thedp article said dual degrees will be covered for a 5th year, but I can be wrong. SFS isn't replying because they're trying to figure this out.

I don't remember if Bio offers a similar exam. Math does as well if your son/daughter took multivariable (or other classes above BC) during high school.

I was trying to address some of the claims @MYOS1634 made regarding AP credits and changes in the double-counting policy for coordinated dual degree programs.\nAs far as your point, I think a way to think about it is to realize that most SEAS single-degree students would still graduate in 4 years under the old policy (or when the current policy was not enforced). Even if students are allowed a fifth year of financial aid, most will still try to graduate in four years (I don't want this to be misconstrued as my saying students don't like Penn and want to get out; that's not what I'm saying here). Taking 5 classes per semester gets a student to 40 credits, so unless the student is failing courses or taking a leave of absence, graduation in 4 years is achievable. I'm pretty sure students who take leaves for mental or personal health reasons will have their financial aid extended. The issue is students who fail courses (I'm only talking about SEAS single-degree students here who aren't pursuing minors).\nIf I had to guess, students who fail and it's not a result of mental or personal health reasons will not get financial aid for an extra semester, and I believe as of now, the belief is that students pursuing dual degrees/second majors or minors will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, which I think they'll find a way to give all these students the financial aid they need because, like you said, it isn't fair.

It's like a perfect storm and I hope the administration is busy fixing it.\n40 credits may be doable, if all goes well and students take 5 credits per semester and never 4 (if, say, they have an internship...) - right of the bat it treats SEAS students differently from College students, as it's more stressful and more than expected at the College, but think: *46* (with no credit and no double counting)?

Remember that some nerves and anxiety coming into freshman year are completely normal and expected. Upon arriving on campus in a month for NSO, you will meet several students who feel the same way as you (even if they may not openly express it).\nI would not worry too much about the urban environment. I'd say the majority of students grew up in the suburbs and transition to the city just fine. It might take a little bit of time to get used to, but overall, I'd say most students enjoy Penn's layout in a city. Also, if you have similar non-academic concerns while you're at Penn, there are many resources you can use to address your concerns. I'd personally recommend a member of your house staff (an RA/GA, house dean, or a faculty fellow or director) who have encountered many other freshmen in similar positions to you.\nWhile @much2learn mentioned how many students in SEAS take 5-6 classes, you're not in SEAS, so there's no reason right now to \"remember that.\" Given that you've expressed some nerves already and that Penn can have a competitive culture at times, I wouldn't worry about what others are taking in other schools, for now. Focus on yourself, take your four classes, and try your best in them.\nEcon 001 is a large class, and the other students will mostly be other freshmen, so it's a good class to meet people and have the chance to work and study with others you may end up taking other classes with later on.\nPSCI 130 is also a large class, and a large portion of your grade is essay based, so your level of success in the class will partially be driven by your writing skills in addition to content knowledge.\nElementary Spanish may be tough if you've never heard Spanish before, but if you've been exposed to Spanish even in the slightest (i.e. Do you know what \"hola\" means?), you will be ok.\nWriting Seminar Craft of Prose is a great move if you want some more assistance developing and enhancing your writing skills. You meet with your teacher and a writing tutor weekly to go over your assignments and progress. Feel free to use the Writing Center to help with other writing assignments, too (like PSCI 130 essays).\nLastly, there are tons of campus resources students either don't know about or don't use that could help them in their transition. The Weingarten Learning Resources Center allows you to meet with a Learning Instructor who will help you plan out your classes and assignments in order to manage stress and help your transition from high school to college academics work out smoothly. Additionally, if in the first week or two of classes, you think one class may be harder than the others, request a tutor at the Tutoring Center. There's no fee at the Tutoring Center, so go take advantage of it if you think it can help you.\nLastly, PSCI is a major that requires only 32 credits to graduate (https://www.college.upenn.edu/credits-needed-major), so you can graduate in 4 years only taking 4 classes each semester.

I didn't know anyone there was no drama. My slates were clean. I started as a journalist and made a group of friends that say with me in my classes. Two girls and a guy. So I met my roommate late. She was late to the dorm or something. She comes off as super shy. She had NO friends at this school. I see her sitting alone at dining times and always has her earbuds. She even attempts to ditch classes. She works as a photographer, and our branch kinda works together. My friends and i had an assignment due on Sunday and it was Friday night. So we all got together in the commons and worked on our interview questions for a press confrence. I ended up going to bed at around 12:02 and she was still in the shower. Not to mention her music was blasting super loud. We also had connected rooms so I felt bad for the other girls. By the look on their faces I knew they felt bad for me too. That night I decided I would put my pjs on and slip under the covers with a thriller novel. So when she got out of the shower and had her pjs on, she didn't stop blasting her music. She literally just brought it in her hand while I was reading. Then she turned off the lights and turned her music down a little but not much. I could still hear it and she quickly went to sleep. I saw a pair of headphones on her nightstand. RIGHT NEXT TO HER BED. Like what?? I like her as a person but she is really inconsiderate. There are many other ways she can be obnoxious but that would take a long time. In conclusion I tiptoed to her bed and turned down her music and placed her earbuds next to her ear. I hope she takes a hint! She is really racist too! She'll face time her Uncle or sister , and they'll make fun of Anglo or Caucasian people (white). She sometimes tells them to stop but it's really rude because sometimes she laughs at those dumb racy jokes. I don't think she knows I'm biracial either (it's really offensive) My mother is pale white and my father is Puerto Rican . My half sisters are all Caucasian. So i sat there just trying not to burst.

West Philly/University City has tremendous diversity - which is what I really like about it. If you just want chain restaurants and to not go off the beaten path - you can do that. There are plenty of options for that. If you explore a little, there is SO much to see - great ethiopian food, quirky stores (a store that only sells popsicles, thrift shops, etc.), nice parks (Clark Park!), music venues, etc.\nIf you want a suburban/rural neighborhood, or a very sanitized neighborhood, then don't apply to Penn. You won't get that. If you're looking for an urban environment that's accessible and affordable for college students, and is also up and coming, you can't go wrong with West Philly.\nIn terms of stuff that I think is NOT good about Penn (only my opinion, of course):\n- It's too large (it is big, and it feels big - big undergrad population, lots of large graduate schools, etc.) Can be easy to get lost in the crowd if you let yourself.\n- A hustle/bustle type of feel - everyone did a million things in high school, and everyone seems to be trying to do the same in college. The admissions office doesn't do a good job of straying from this \"type\" - they like well-rounded students - kids who try to do (and try to succeed at) a million different things. For some, it can feel exhausting to be surrounded by this archetype.\n- Competitive applications/feel for some student clubs - for some clubs, lots of tryouts, submitting resumes, etc. It can feel intense. This relates to the \"hustle/bustle\" feel described above.\n- Too high a percentage of students in greek life (I think it's about 25-30%, which I think is high)\n- Pre-professional feel - per the career surveys, traditional careers (finance, medicine, law) remain very popular at Penn. They place well for PhD programs and the like, but few students go this route.\n- Decentralized admin support and YMMV - there are lots of places to go for different things, so it can feel decentralized. Also, some admins are great, others are not (have heard horror stories about Student Financial Services, the Registrar's Office, etc.)\n- Overvaluing success and undervaluing failure - there seems to be pressure to \"succeed\" and this sometimes comes in the way of learning through failure, and sometimes just learning for the sake of learning - for some people, \"Return on investment\" is something people think about in their decision making.

Penn is by no means a pristine no-mans land where you can leave your door unlocked but the campus is pretty safe.\nGoing as far west as 46th street is actually quite safe if you stay in the main streets that run through campus (market, chestnut, sansom, walnut, locust. spruce). After 50th-55th st, it starts to get kind of sketchy/unsafe.\nYou sure do not need a buddy to get across campus. It might be a good idea to do so if you are crossing campus at 3-4am but even then it is not necessary if you are in central campus locations (say from the library to the high rises or the quad). I did it countless times as an undergrad and not once did i have an issue. and same goes for many of my friends.\n30th street station is definitely not safe to get to from campus on foot at a reasonable hour of the day. Even after hours it is definitely not very unsafe but obviously more caution should be exercised as is the case with any place.\nHousing is not formally guaranteed for all 4 years but practically it is. Most people move off campus after freshman or sophomore year so there are plenty of openings for upperclassmen who actually do get priority for the high rises over freshmen.\nThe difficulty of getting into clubs depends on the club you re talking about. There are many clubs that do not require a multi-stage screening process, including many volunteering/community service clubs.\nGoing out does not have to have a tab. The $500/$1000-a-weekend crowd is a very small percentage of the Penn student population, mainly some super-rich kids in some frats/sororities. There are a lot of people who spend anywhere from $30 to $100 in a typical week to go out but there are also many kids who do not go out every weekend and cannot afford to pay that, who then find alternative ways to have fun, such as house parties or cheaper bars etc. Of course Penn has a lot of wealthy kids but there are equally as many kids from modest backgrounds who are on financial aid.

It's that simple - it'll never feel like being at Dartmouth or Williams or even a more suburban-ish/scrubbed clean school like Wash U.\nYou'll never be able to make Penn feel suburban or rural. You could, on the other hand, make a school like Tufts or Duke (two schools with a more suburban feel) feel more urban (given their proximity to bustling urban areas).@HyperTurbo - I think the food is a non-issue. Yes, Penn dining hall food isn't what you'd find at Cornell or Wash U (two schools with excellent food), but you also can leave housing after the first year if you want, and there are tons of options for food in West Philly - cheap, good food trucks, grocery stores, niche restaurants, etc. etc.\nRe CAPS - yes, I've heard that too, but they are expanding. The issue is they were understaffed for so long, and this is frankly because Penn, at its huge size, doesn't have the wealth of its more well-resourced, smaller peers. Given recent mental health crises on campus, though, they are expanding CAPS, Student Health Services, etc. CAPS used to be in an AWFUL location on 36th and walnut - they moved recently, although a bit farther from the center of campus.\nRe pressure - in my experience students DO NOT compete AGAINST one another, but an overall feeling of pressure DOES exist. I met many students who had this general feeling that others were \"succeeding,\" and they needed to keep up. It was pressure in a vague sense, but it was palpable. It's why one Wharton prof said Penn's hyper-competitive culture is the worst he's ever seen.

Also, unlike other Ivy League schools, we have the Big 5, which is a city basketball rivalry between Penn, Villanova, Temple, St. Joe's and LaSalle. However, the rivalry has lost its luster in recent years. From my freshman year to senior year, you could see the difference among student interest at all the schools - Penn students don't care except for the Villanova game, Villanova's student section didn't show up for the Penn game at the Palestra this past season (Penn hasn't had a lead against Villanova in 8 years, so they maybe didn't think it was worth the trip to see Villanova win easily), and Penn students no longer travel for away Big 5 games (my freshman and sophomore year, students traveled for the Villanova and Temple games, respectively).

I was very impressed by Columbia's crowd when Penn men's basketball played there this past season and don't think we would've been able to replicate the intensity of that crowd and game had it been at the Palestra.\n\"UPenn seems more consistent on that front\" Definitely not! That's one of the big problems. I've been to multiple basketball games where there were fewer than 20 students in the student section (we'd joke there were more players on the team than in the student section). The past two years, the Red and Blue was inconsistent. There were many games when no one from the club board showed up (but of course they showed up to all the big games and took all the credit for leading and organizing the student section at those games).\nEdit: addressing women's bball point...I 100% agree that the new women's bball coach is great and turned that program into a dominant force. Unfortunately, very few students care and the only students who support them at their games are other athletes and the players' close friends.

I say this not to make you feel bad, but to let others know that the area around Penn is quite safe. You write \"the 30th street station to campus was considered extremely unsafe\"-- First you wouldn't take the 30th, you'd take the 34th. But second, considered by whom? I mean, I wouldn't go at 1 am (just take an uber). But I've used SEPTA for over a decade. And homeless people roaming around campus? This is just untrue.\nIt's possible people feeding misinformation are going by what Penn was like 10-15 years ago, when it was indeed less safe. Now, however, the campus and the city area through about 42nd or so is quite safe--certainly not \"extremely unsafe.\" Yes, as you go further west, you will get into high crime areas. But there is no need to go there--students would not go there unless they wanted to. And it's also smart to use your head and not get yourself into unsafe situations (eg walking around the city at 3 am alone, or engaging in dicey deals).\nAs far as Philly as a city--it's gotten a lot better and continues to do so. Yes there are areas that are high crime; don't go there. There's no reason for a student to do so. Center City has so much to offer and if you use your head, it's quite safe.\nThat said, Penn is embedded in the city, so if you don't like an urban environment, I would think that would be setting yourself up for misery. I mean, there's lots of nature around - parks you can go to, hiking etc - but it's not the same as a small LAC in a small town college. However, as far as the extreme lack of safety, that's untrue.

There is this feeling at Penn that your peers are doing and achieving so much and you need to stay on pace, but again I don't think this is too different from many other top tier schools.\nFirst off, they were already admitted to their specific undergraduate school because their intended pursuits align with the specific goals of the school and careers they are going for. Aside from the combined-double degree programs (yet another example of Penn caterizing to specialized future pursuits), The students in Nursing (only undergrad program in the entire ivy league) were admitted because they showed in their application that they were very focused and passionate about pursuing nursing. Same with Wharton and business/leadership.

Maybe they joined a math club or quiz bowl team or something, but pretty much they went to Harvard and dove into doing math.\nI haven't seen that as much at Penn. Maybe I just missed it, but there seemed to be less of that deep diving into certain subject areas going on. Everyone seemed to be doing a lot - it might be narrowed by professional interest - but they were doing a lot in that space.

Additionally, AP scores consider little to no weight in the admissions process, and AO's are not looking to \"redeem\" one score with an offset of another.\nHowever, the key, as another poster mentioned, is that admissions if holistic. Subject Tests are just one part of the equation, and a 760 is a great score. If you get rejected for a 760, you would not have gotten accepted with an 800, IMO. Spend the time polishing your essays.

I also recommend writing essays that will humanize you to the admissions committee - there are a lot of people that build compsci focuses, but because most of these people specialize in left-brain analytical thinking, you will greatly improve your chances if you're able to craft a compelling, cohesive, and personal application narrative (especially with your status as an ORM, unfortunately).

Perhaps there is something we are not considering or thinking about.\nThis is regarding S18: High scoring candidate (single sitting 36ACT, 1530 SAT, likely NMF) with mediocre grades (3.85 UW 4.1W) limited EC, and potentially uncompelling essays. So, please understand, the context of the question is viewed with the understanding that either option is a severe reach. Eyes wide open. This is not a \u201cChance\u201d thread\u2026. his chances are slim.\nBut \u2026.he will likely use one of his precious \u201creach\u201d applications to apply to one of the following: Princeton | Penn.\nConsiderations:\n1. He will NOT have an opportunity to visit either one until/unless he is accepted. We live far away, so logistics will be similar at each. He would be thousands of miles, a train ride, and a couple plane connections away.\n2. All things being equal \u2026 he would prefer a smaller environment, not necessarily a big city person.\n3. When he thinks \u201ccollege\u201d, the image that pops in to his head is probably Princeton. I mean, quite literally the campus and romanticism of the residential colleges, etc.\n4. He will study Math/Applied Math, with the current plan of Actuarial Sciences as a career. That\u2019s subject to change of course as all things related to 17 year olds are\u2026.\n5. Our typical NPC/EFC is far from reality at most schools. Given their high household income range bands, Princeton\u2019s calculator helps and is close to something we could afford. Penn\u2019s is likely less favourable. All of that is subject to unknowns but is what we have to go with.\n6. Princeton\u2019s comprehensive undergraduate focus is a plus. It is an approach S18 would be generally comfortable with. Somewhat helpful for the unknown factor.\n7. Penn\u2019s opportunities in Math are unique. As I understand, their Actuarial Sciences Minor seems to be a partnership with Statistics through Wharton and the Math Department in the A&S School. I think you declare as an A&S Math Major. This would be a hard to pass up opportunity IF he really knows that is what he wants to do.\n8. Unlikely to matter, but I am not aware of any recent graduates of his high school going to Penn. There have been several recently to go to Princeton.\n9. Because of financial concerns, any binding or semi binding early applications are probably out. SCEA (Princeton) and ED (Penn) probably can not be accommodated.\n10. Son is fairly socially conservative. I don't mean poltically per se, and he is more than open to all types of people and discussions, but he is relatively conservative from a social perspective.\nMy current lean is toward Princeton. Despite the more targeted math focus opportunity at Penn, I think he would be more comfortable at Princeton. It would almost certainly be more affordable, to the effect that he probably could not attend Penn, but might be able to swing Princeton.\nAnd one last time \u2026 We don\u2019t expect either to be an acceptance.\n(EDIT: added item 10) ", "user_id": "100572244", "user_name": "DavidPuddy ", "user_thread_count": "26", "user_comment_count": "625"}, {"date": {"month": "July", "day": "11,", "year": "2017", "time": "11:15AM"}, "comment": "\nRegarding 9, SCEA at Princeton is not binding at all - we had the same financial concerns but had no reason not to apply SCEA.

In my opinion, it is a better fit for your son. Don't get too caught up in the fact that Penn has an actuarial science program. There are only 4 actuarial science courses total and they just teach to the test for 4 of the SOA/CAS exams. If your son wants to become an actuary, he can still do that by going to Princeton and self-studying (or using an online resource like The Infinite Actuary, etc.) for the exams. If your son has some free time this summer, he can study for and try taking Exam P and/or FM later this summer or this fall.

I got waitlisted for Wharton. Because I participated in a national innovation contest my junior year ( we won for our state and nationally, in the top 15 places), I was on the news twice. The CEO and President of Samsung Electronics North America wrote me a personal letter of recommendation address to Dean Eric Furda ( and emailed/mailed it to him). For my update, I provided UPENN with that l.o.r. as well as 3 more l.o.r ( 1 from my pastor because I am a devoted Christian and I do a lot of activities in the church, one of them was from my 10th grade English teacher who was supposed to give me the letter since October but I finally got it way pass admission deadlines so I used that one, and one more from the advisor of one of the clubs that I am the secretary of... which was only a paragraph long and not that good.) My exam scores are not that good (28 on both ACTs, 1770 in Dec 2015, 1310 in Apr 2016, 1350 in Oct/Nov 2016, 3 on WHAP, 4 on APUSH and AP Eng Lang, 5 on AP Psych). At the time I applied, I was #3 with a 4.9 something weighted GPA but as of current I am #4 with a 5.0 weighted GPA. I am the secretary of 2 clubs ( one is based on a certification/magnet program that my school has and the other is a club for \"at-risk\" or financial unstable young ladies.) I used to be the secretary of SGA my junior year but I left during senior year. I've been in 8+ clubs throughout high school. I did not have a real \"job\" during high school. I currently have 300 service hours but I could have had put in the rest of them if I wanted to but. I am currently in a \"magnet\" program at my school called Industrial Biotechnology where students learn about that industry, culture bacteria, alter DNA, complete gel electrophoresis, etc. The program started our freshman year (when most of us were in Biology Honors.) We are the first graduating class from the program and just took the certification exam a few weeks ago.\nI'm a black girl (with a single mom and an afro-Hispanic father who isn't really in my life). We currently live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and I'm from a public high school that is currently ranked as a \"D\" school. My mom makes less than $30k annually. I want to be an Industrial and Organizational Psychologist. I can't really tell you why I was waitlisted except that God is good and favors me immensely.\nI noticed a few people are getting calls and emails from UPENN so I'm praying that I'm next. I got accepted to UF with a full ride, which is where I will be attending if I am rejected by UPENN (which is my top choice university.) I got accepted into all the other universities I applied to except Columba and NYU. I'm honestly no competition for anyone and I am still shocked that I even got waitlisted.\nIn my LOCI I talked about some of the volunteer projects I participated in (giving out bags of sanitary items to homeless women, donating clothes and shoes to a local middle school for their prom, creating a school pantry for homeless students), my church activities (women's fellowship, Drive-thru prayer, discipleship class, a marriage conference), my online store, Samsung Solve for Tomorrow, a short film I was directing and producing for my humanities 2 class, a science -based relay race I was planning for one of my clubs, etc.\nMy current schedule is not competitive. Biotech 3 Hon, AP GOV/Econ Hon (1/2 credit of each, same class period and teacher), Pre-Calc Ho (5th year of math, I wanted AP stats for 2 years in a row and I couldn't be enrolled because Biotech, which is mandatory for me, was scheduled during the same block), Humanities 2 Hon ( I didn't take hum 1 hon), Spanish 3 hon, AP Eng Lit, Classical Lit Hon (this gives me 5 English credits) and study hall ( no credit.)\nI do apologize for my terrible grammar. I'm tired and this upcoming week is my finally week before finals. Prom was Friday. My birthday was the day before that. This Tuesday is Senior Awards Night (principal decided to stop giving us cords but all the seniors were outraged so we contacted the school board and the superintendent and now we will be the last graduating class that gets our graduation cords at Senior Award Night.

If you managed to get into LSM then you are done. If you do not get into LSM but you get into CAS or Wharton,then you can apply for an uncoordinated dual degree program at the end of your freshman or sophomore year at Penn.\nThe curriculum of the uncoordinated dual degree and LSM is essentially the same but I think you need to take more classes as an uncoordinated dual degree than LSM since LSM double counts some requirements between CAS and Wharton. The difference between LSM and uncoordinated is that LSM provides a lot of individualized guidance and mentoring in terms of academic and internship opportunities and also access to its really tight-knit alumni network in addition to the wider Penn alumni network. There is a special LSM office dedicated only to students in the LSM program. This is true for the rest of the coordinated dual degree programs at Penn.

GPA needs to be moderately high though (~3.70 for Wharton Transfer/uncoordinated dual degree acceptance and ~3.85+ for LSM transfer). LSM is a fantastic program. You can do pre-med even as a Wharton single degree candidate and of course as a dual-degree candidate. Dual degree does however entail a significantly higher amount of coursework so you would certainly have to work a lot harder as a pre-med with a potential hit to the GPA (which is honestly a very important factor for med school admissions). Additionally, it doesn't seem like med schools appreciate the dual degree background enough to give much leeway in evaluating the GPA for admissions. Bottom line is, only do the dual degree if you genuinely think you'll benefit from the education and are willing to accept the fact that your GPA might suffer or at the very least you will have to work significantly harder (would estimate ~1.5x compared to single degree).

LSM, as mentioned in this thread already, gives you a lot of benefits you wouldn't get with the uncoordinated line. However there is a forewarning: you should really only consider either IF you are GENUINELY interested in a double degree in both fields. ESPECIALLY for LSM, if you aren't passionate about specifically the combination of life sciences and business, you would NOT enjoy your time there even if you end up getting in. For uncoordinated, albeit not encouraged, people sometimes get away with the \"i just want a wharton degree\" thinking.\nAnyway, a dual is feasible but of course not easy. Whether Coordinated or Uncoordinated, it's a lot of work, with some people (not everyone, depending on what intro classes you place out of, whether you make up classes in the summer, etc.) having to max out on courses/credits per semester. (And now you can see why without double counting, it's slightly more challenging to fit everything in when you are doing uncoordinated). This is also why unless you really like both subject areas, it will suck having to put those extra hours learning things you are not super interested in.\nI actually did not get into LSM initially when I applied as an entering freshman, but I was very fortunate to be able to transfer in after finishing my freshman year. The way it works is you have to go through a whole application process with interview, recs, essays, etc. as well as the 3.6+ GPA requirement. You ARE allowed to apply to both LSM transfer and uncoordinated dual degree at the same time. LSM notifies you earlier than Uncoordinated so if you get in you can withdraw your uncoordinated application if need be.\nAt the end of sophomore year, you also have another chance to apply for uncoordinated (even if you applied a year prior and didn't get in).
