I go to a super competitive, top 300 HS in the States, so it wasn't a huge surprise when I figured out there are 4 other prospective applicants to the Wharton school early decision this year. 3 of these applicants are just typical US high school students with great grades, great personalities, and a normal life.\n1 applicant, however, is not. He/she is the son of two Wharton MBA graduates, so he/she gets a huge legacy boost (Penn loves their legacies, I've heard). In addition, he/she told me (without knowing that I am looking to apply to Wharton as well) that his/her dad donates hundreds of thousands of dollars to Penn regularly. This student lives in a multi-million dollar house, drives a nice car-- he/she makes it known that they're extremely well off in our school.\nThis student has a 4.0UW GPA and a 36 on his/her ACT, but no extracurriculars or leadership. My stats are on this thread (https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/what-my-chances/2174701-should-i-push-for-an-ivy-league-school-if-so-which-ones.html#latest). I do not have legacy, and my family is middle class. We definitely do not have enough money to be donating money like that to Penn.\nWould Penn just pick this other student without giving equal consideration to the other 4 applicants because of his/her legacy status / donor status? Does being a legacy / child of a donor boost chances to the point where AOs admit them regardless of lack of merit?

Its like they have no interest or care in their own history, which... in general... really bothers me. Its the general attitude of \"That was a long time ago, nobody is alive from that era so who cares?\" that really frustrates me about today's culture in general, but I digress. In a time when the concept of a 'Hall of Fame' was not on anyone's radar, there was no social media besides newspapers of the day and no TV, no video recordings just eye witness accounts that would later come to apparently mean nothing... there was a fascinating story that would shape sports in the region (the Ivy league) and Basketball in particular as a sport worldwide. The person I outline below was literally the greatest player of his era and was widely considered the greatest to ever play the game until it changed drastically a half century later... but he is forgotten (or ignored) by time.\nIn the early 1900's there were no professional Leagues (besides baseball), no Halls of Fame, no recognition of accomplishments besides what professional sports writers of the day covered and wrote about for posterity. But that was their job as professionals to report the facts, and give unbiased accounts... which now apparently count for nothing. When Helms created his 'Hall of Fame' it was a labor of love and passion and research to use first hand accounts, interviews, phone calls, letter writing and other now archaic but exhaustive forms of communication to come up with a 'Hall of fame' Recognizing just a very few standouts for their accomplishments and contributions and impact on the game for the previous several decades. This covered roughly the first 80 years of the game. Since the Hall was disbanded in the 1960's the new Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame inexplicably chose to leave a few of these people out with no explanation, but then has gone on to enshrine more than 400 inductees. In fact, they enshrine more people over the course of every 2 or 3 years than Helms recognized in his entire retrospective of the sports first 80 years combined! I understand there is now an NBA and more colleges than there used to be, but I truly believe this omission is unjust and egregious, especially if you look at the facts and compare any of the enshrined members accomplishments within several decades of his time before or after. Keep in mind this was a different time, the game was vastly different for a very long time but his contributions in part helped shape what it would become and apples to apples there simply was no one better.\nThis person who is inexplicably left out is Charles 'Kid' Keinath. Arguably the best (at least one of the very best) basketball players in the first half of the 20th century.\n*4-time FIRST Team All American (one of only 2 people ever to accomplish this feat)\n*2-time EIL and National scoring leader\n*Scored all of his teams points in a game at least twice\n*1909 National Co-Champions w/ Chicago Univ. (*unofficial)\n*Outscored the combined efforts of HOF'ers Schommer and Page in 1908 Championship series (1st ever National Championship series!)\n*2 EIL championships (would have had a 3rd but the EIL disbanded his senior year)\n*1st to score 100 points in league play in a season\n*Record 23 points in a game stood for almost 40 years! (before rules changes drastically increased scoring, when whole teams averaged about 15 points a game)\n*Played on and then coached Philadelphia City High School Championship teams as well\n*Most notably\u2026 the double dribble rule was changed because of him (and yes, I have a lot of documentation to support this claim!)\nIn Football:\n*Led team to a National Championship over Michigan in 'The Big House'\n*Standout QB called \u201cThe Little General\u201d\n*Innovator and one of the early successful QBs to utilize forward pass\n*Anecdotally: He was selected for enshrinement into the Helm\u2019s Hall of Fame (out of Los Angeles) as only one of a few collegiate players to represent the first half century off basketball in the country, he coached against and befriended Glen \u201cPop\u201d Warner. He played Against (and often got the better of) Jim Thorpe, John Heisman selected him as his assistant coach where he spent the next 30 years coaching (many alongside Charles Wharton\u2026 of Wharton school fame).\n*I have newspaper clippings of the time calling him \u201cthe Red Grange of basketball\u201d, and one with his picture from the sports page simply titled \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Basketball Player, Kid Keinath\u201d, he was compared in articles of major newspapers even decades later to Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Hagen, Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, Johnny Weismuller, Man-O-War, John L. Sullivan, Max Schmelling, and Jack Dempsey among MANY other All Time greats in their sports. He was to basketball what these other All time greats were to their sports, as documented by professional sports writers of that era.\n*A member of UPenn\u2019s HOF as well I am trying to see him recognized by other entities. As you know, as Halls of Fame really only started to come about AFTER the 1960\u2019s for the most part\u2026 that was over 50 years since he last played. Since then time has only served to further blurr his accomplishments and with the advent of online media the \u2018old timers\u2019 are largely forgotten unless someone has cared to comb through scarce hard copy material and document the past for future electronic preservation and accessibility (something I hope to do).

I think that those should propel you further into the application process. The NHS, Farmer's Market, sneaker reselling, etc... those don't really matter just because everyone's got something like that on their resume. Sneaker reselling isn't exactly appealing to admissions officers and the general public who probably think the business is super shady and backdoor.\nYou're also lacking some national awards / international awards. As much as colleges like to see involvement, they like to see winners and placements. So making 90k revenue is great, but making 90k on top of winning Conrad? That would edge you out.\nHowever, besides the lack of national rankings / international rankings / awards, your extracurriculars are very, very impressive and I'd say your ECs won't get you rejected.\nI think the biggest issue would be your SAT. A 1450 is lower than the 25th percentile, putting you at risk that admissions won't get to your application.

Haven't taken any others, but looking into SAT II Korean and Literature.\nACT: I'm taking the February 8th exam  Super nervous for it\nGPA (Unweighted / Weighted): 4.83 / 4.0.\nRanking: Our school provides percentages. My class size is 600 and I am in the top 2%, which means I'm sandwiched between 1% and 2%, so anywhere from 6-12th.\nAdditional Notes: I have a weird transcript because I took the IB Diploma. A lot of things are weird, like how many credits I have as well as how everything is calculated. I took 5 APs (Gov, Calc BC, World, Compsci Pri, Lang) before beginning the IB program as a junior. Right now I take 7 credits a year, so I'll graduate with 34 ish credits (acceleration programs in my middle school allowed a few kids to get high school credit early). Important thing to note: out of 600 kids in my class, only 20 are in the IB program.

Clients have included Smoothie King, Sankranti (local restaurant), and UI Dynamics (a web development company), so a mix of large franchises / local businesses.\nCMO at LearnLink, LLC; my friends and I started this company two years back to provide online video solutions for our county system. It lets users collaborate on live video channels hosted over multiple connections to get rid of annoying lag time. We also have a platform on there to sell / distribute old textbooks. LearnLink is widely used in a number of schools in our county because we were able to franchise the business out to other high schools.\nFounder of FAST Tutoring: FAST is a program I started to help kids who couldn't afford private tutors (a rare but unfortunately necessary commodity where I live). I run it at the local library.\nAssistant Coach at my old middle school. I love this position because I get to coach at the school I used to attend; I teach debate and public speaking after school.\nCoach at IBA: this is a paid job that I go to on the weekends. I teach debate here.\nStudent Council Member (2017-Present)\nFBLA Member (2017-Present)\nDebate:\n1st place team, Harvard Nationals 2019, Cambridge, MA\n1st place individual speaker, NSDA 2017, Birmingham, AL\n3rd place individual speaker, Harvard 2019, Cambridge, MA\nQuarterfinalist, Georgetown 2018, Washigton D.C.\nOctofinalist, Georgetown 2019 Washington D.C.\nQuarterfinalist, NSDA 2017, Birmingham, AL\nSemifinalists (ranked 3rd), International Public Policy Forum Championships, NYC\nMusic Composition:\nPublished Artist on Spotify (I'm an Asian that makes Spanish reggaeton!

I was born and raised in a Korean household, and I was sent to Korean school every Sunday until I was 12. One of my closest friend's mom is a Spanish teacher, so I picked up Spanish to a fluent level by sophomore year of high school (she's been teaching me since Pre-K).\nI saw Karate Kid one day and decided I wanted to try my luck at Tae-Kwon Doe.

IMO this forum is best suited for people in the application process, not middle school students.\nAnd honestly there is no need for snark on your part. Be appreciative that people genuinely want to help you.\nSetting a path is wonderful. But It is WAY TO EARLY to think about specific colleges (especially the hyper-competitive ones like Penn) and it is WAY WAY WAY TOO EARLY to think about going to Wharton grad school.\nYou need to recognize that middle school and HS should be experiences in and of themselves-- times of learning and growth and maturity -- these are not just a college prep experiences. Your focus should be on getting the most out of where you are now.\nIt is good to take school seriously and know that college will be on your horizon, but it is simply too early to start asking about specific colleges. I would highly recommend that you get off of CC until your junior year (except for the HS life forum when you are in HS). For the next few years you should focus on:\n--Working hard, learning, and doing as well as you can in the most challenging curriculum you can manage.\n--When the time comes study for standardized tests.\n--Getting involved in activities you care about and work towards making meaningful contributions to those activities.\n--Enjoying spending time with your family and friends.\nIn addition, setting up Penn as your dream school when you are in 8th grade is a dangerous proposition. The people I have seen over the years who are most likely to get hurt by the college admission process are the ones who focus on one or two hyper-competitive schools and then don't get in. When the time comes (junior year) your focus should not be on Penn but should be on creating a solid college list that includes reach, match, and safety schools that appear affordable (find out your parents' budget and run the net price calculator for each school) and that you would be happy to attend.\nKeep posting if you like...I can't stop you.

You are saying it is.\n4) I find it kind of offensive that you have to put me on the \"ignore\" status when you can just rather calm down, genuinely ignore me, or support me (which I evidently prefer).\n5) UPenn isn't my \"dream school.\" My dad went there, which is why I am so interested in it. I obviously know that I might get accepted or rejected. And obviously, I am going to apply to way more schools. My goal is \"GREAT college.\" Not Penn. Not Harvard. Not MIT. Not any school in particular. The main reason I ask Penn related questions is 1) it has the number 1 business school in the world. 2) A great SEAS (top 20 I believe.) 3) My dad went to graduate school at Wharton.\nIn closing, I would rather you not give me a lecture about how planning ahead is too \"early\" for me.

As a teacher at Wharton, I'd say you're not out of line in asking such questions ... I'll attempt to answer.\nThe blended Class of 2024 ED admit rate for all four Penn undergrad schools was 19.7%. The blended Class of 2023 overall admit rate for all four schools was 7.44%, while the ED rate was 18%.\nAs for Wharton undergrad admission rates, there seems to be no reliable info online; the Poets & Quants website lists it as 8% (no date given), but I think we can assume the Wharton admit rates are not higher than Penn's blended rates. In a nutshell, if you are competitive for Wharton, you'd probably be competitive for admission to any college in the U.S.\nPenn's Class of 2023 blended yield (the percentage of admittees who attend, a measure of relative exclusivity) was 70% which is very high. Harvard and Stanford had the best yields nationwide at 82-83%.\nAs for legacy status, word is that Penn counts grad school attendance of parent(s) for legacy status, so it would seem you are a legacy. Word is also that legacy status approximately doubles your chance of ED admission, but doesn't count in RD. This policy seems odd given the current Penn admissions numbers and may well change by the time you apply. Also, if you've been following the news you know there's a nationwide movement to stop giving legacies preference in elite college admissions.\nGL to you and don't miss out on being a kid and having fun as you prepare for college and adulthood.

Holistic admissions will not make up for subpar stats.\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of excellent schools where a kid with a 1290/3.9 would have an outstanding shot at admissions, unfortunately the highly selective schools with the single digit (or close to it) admit rates are not among them.

I've known many seniors who made the mistake of doing terrible on the SAT but not even trying the ACT. Penn accepts both the SAT and the ACT -- no test has more importance in the application process. And since you're a junior, you have PLENTY of time to work on the ACT. (Don't be like me who took the ACT in October of my senior year lol)\nAs for grades, keep on taking the most rigorous classes your school offers (but at the same time, don't take classes that will completely damage your grade). UPenn checks to see the hardest classes your school has and compares that to the class you're taking.\nP.S.\nIf you are a minority or come from a low-income household, look into Penn's fly-in program called 'PEEP.'

Congratulations on your acceptance!! I am a mom of a Wharton senior and I can share a few things I have learned from my son about his experience- re things that have helped him along the way. It has been an amazing experience for him, I'm sure it will be for you too!\nDefinitely join the admitted students facebook page and connect connect connect w fellow students in any way you can. My son is still friends w many people he met that way. There might be local meet ups in your area w fellow incoming freshmen, these are great ways to start meeting people - not to be missed. My son found the key to navigating Penn and the finance world was reaching out to fellow classmates esp upperclassmen for advice. I can't stress this enough! There are so many opportunities available at Penn, but easy to miss if you aren't on the look out or clued in by upperclassmen...\nNot sure about quaker days as they had an ED Quaker day when son was a freshman that has been discontinued. I doubt finance firms host info tents (other than credit card co's trying to sign you up lol) as most big banks no longer recruit on campus, instead they recruit straight from their websites. Recruiting timelines for finance changed substantially during his last 3 yrs and are continuing to change. You really need to be proactive and research this. The best place to find info out about finance recruiting is in the forums of a website called Wall Street Oasis. Google it and read everything you can.\nThe club scene was uber competitive. Penn has taken many steps to alleviate some of that- not sure if it worked or not?. Best advice is to persevere! If you don't get into your dream club first semester, keep trying! Network, talk to people, reach out to upperclassmen etc... Some of the more competitive clubs take people w connections or people from their elite high schools first, but if you persevere you will succeed. Don't fret though, there are many clubs and you will find a fit. If you identify as any part of a diversity group I can't stress enough how important it is to join those groups. There are special recruiting programs and helpful advice found in these groups that was invaluable!\nNot sure about the frats- son didn't join any. It's about 50-50 participation. They seem to be popular w freshmen and sophomores, not so much jr sr's. Son knows guys that did and they seemed to enjoy the experience but it is very time consuming. That is one of the biggest things at Penn he said -so many things to do and be involved w, but not enough time in the days. Read up on and develop good time management skills will be key. There is a visible wealthy population and it is easy to get caught up in spending a lot of money on downtowns or social things.

My daughter was admitted ED last year. We felt Quaker Days was useless for students admitted via ED as most of the programming focused on getting RD students to commit to Penn.

My daughter did enjoy the closing session/pep rally because it heightened the excitement she already felt. Apparently, Dean Furda knows how to hype up a crowd.\nSome clubs are more competitive to join than others, but there are many opportunities to get involved. There will be a club fair during the first week of classes where you can get information about the various clubs and requirements. Candidates for the class board began campaigning during the summer via social media so that is something to keep in mind if you are interested in student government. Most of my daughter's socializing occurs within her club sport and residential program community.\nMy daughter has found the key to navigating the competing demands is setting limits and asking for help. She was very involved in high school (multiple sports, clubs, etc.) and Penn mirrors her high school in that way; everyone is doing a lot of activities and it's easy to feel like you should be doing more. At one point, she was questioning whether she should add more activities to her already packed schedule. We had a serious talk about her tendency to take on too much and I'll tell you what I told her: \"This is your journey and it is fine to set limits. Life is not a competition.\"\nThere are wealthy students at Penn, but students can have fun without spending a lot of money. There are many social and cultural opportunities available at no cost through the college houses. My daughter has friends from all economic classes and says no one discusses money.\nLastly, take time to build relationships. My daughter's RAGAs (Residential Advisers and Graduate Associates) and House Fellows have been an invaluable resource.

You do have one clear thing that you're interested in, which is a good thing, but your essay reads off as a resume of sorts: \"I did this. Then I did this.\" You did things, that's great, but where were the defining moments that made this path so meaningful to you? What, specifically, about the school makes it such a good fit for you? The crux of the essay is not your interest, but rather how you will explore it. You'll need more than one example of a club to make a \"Why\" essay effective. What about class offerings? Characteristics about the school, like Penn's more liberal arts focus?\nFor essay #2: Kind of parrots off of the first essay. This should be about community, not about academics.

As an interviewer for another Ivy, I think of this as the most important over anything else. In my 5 years as an interviewer, not a single applicant was able to come up with anything remotely considered a decent answer to this #1 \"fitness\" question, incredible as it sounds. WHY does your child want to go to UPenn in particular and not any other schools? If your child can answer that, then your D would be in good shape. Of course, your D, I'm sure, is also interested in other schools since UPenn isn't a sure thing, but your D needs convincing reasons why UPenn is a great fit like no other.\nHaving said that, interviews don't make or break your D's admissions chances. My son didn't even have an interview with UPenn, yet was admitted, so that ought to tell you how much weight these interviews carry. As long as your D knows why she wants UPenn, then she can just relax, be herself and enjoy the rest of the interview session. If she really interested in UPenn, then I'm sure she'd have a set of questions about UPenn -- unlike 99.9% of the kids that I've interviewed over the years -- and that'd demonstrate her \"interest\" in UPenn. If she's really really and genuinely interested in UPenn, then she'd have a simple courtesy of sending a thank you email shortly after the interview session, unlike so many kids that I've interviewed.

His interview was with a woman from our area that had graduated from the M&T program about 7 years ago. They met at our local library. My son said it was a very informal conversation where the interviewer wanted to know why he was interested in Penn and especially the M&T program. ( I agree with TiggerDad about \"Why this college/university\" being the #1 question your child will be asked on any interview. My son went on 6 interviews and was asked this question at every single one). She also asked him about various activities he had done in high school and how could he see himself continuing those things at Penn. He asked her what she liked about Penn and especially what she had thought of the M&T program and why she had chosen to go there instead of another college. Overall he said it was a very relaxed conversation and he really enjoyed talking to her. I know he was told for the M&T program the interview weighs alot for your application. I would assume it is the same for the other programs too.\nThe interview itself lasted about an hour. My son dressed business casual eventhough they met in a library. He brought a copy of his resume in a business folder just in case she asked for it, which she did not.\nMy son's interviewer contacted him via email so make sure your child is checking that every day and replying promptly. My son did send his interviewer a thank you email after the interview. She was also the first one to contact him and congratulate him on his acceptance to M&T at Penn. He is currently enrolled there and is loving it.\nA few tips......... make sure your child arrives a few minutes early to the interview. Being late is not the first impression you want the interviewer to have. Dress appropriately for the interview. Business casual is always a safe way to go. The interview is for your child, not the parent. So do not go in with your child.

Emphasize why you chose those fields and what career you want to go into in your essays and interview.\nNow, as for Dartmouth, you do express the diversity of interests and accomplishments (with a spike in one or two fields) that are appreciated in a lib arts undergrad curriculum like the one Dartmouth has. Now, fit and therefore your chances depend on whether you like rural places and the various things to do at Dartmouth related to your field and outside that excite you, and pull you towards Dartmouth. These have to be specific (for the other ivies as well). Here's the thing; It's not worth applying to an elite school if you are not interested in specific things about it, and how some of them can help you achieve your goal in life. They want to see how you view their school as your jumping-off place to the world, and how you will use the education they give you. They do not want to see people applying to an ivy for the name value.\nYou also might want to consider some schools for lower reaches and possibles.
