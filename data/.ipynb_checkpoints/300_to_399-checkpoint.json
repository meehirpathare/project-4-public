One of them (and the only way I found out was going to my academic advisor and from friends) was that you can now graduate with AT MOST 2 concentrations. I've known lots of people who have done 3+ concentrations and I think its dumb how Wharton is controlling what types of things we want to study. I spoke to my advisor and she said even if we were to take all the classes that fulfill three concentrations, we can't put it on our diploma (we can only choose two of those).\nWhat does everyone think of this change? Also- is it even legal for them to do that because when i got in, there was no such rule until THIS YEAR....????

I am actually doing the hardest IB option possible, where you take 4 HL courses instead of 3, which is very unusual\nUnweighted GPA: 4.0\nWeighted GPA: 5.303 (my school does weighted GPAs super weird, so my rank is probably a little more revealing than my GPA)\nRank: 6/261\nExtracurriculars:\nMock Trial, all 4 years of high school, became captain my junior year; I have 11 most effective attorney awards as well as a most dependable award\nStudent Activism club, founder\nIntern at our local chamber of commerce every week\nVolunteered on a congressional campaign this summer against 3 term incumbent until campaign ended\nWork as a runner at a local law firm about 7 hours a week\nVolunteer at our local museum where I help with kids activities\nMember of the National Honors Society, Science National Honors Society, and German National Honors Society (these are all the ones my schools offers).\nBeta club\nMath team (1 year) and soccer (1 year) - not that important but I think I checked the box on the application\nJunior Marshal at our school, which only the top 20 students get to do\nAwards:\nMock trial (mentioned above)\nSilver on the National German Exam\nVarsity letter in academics (I know it\u2019s weird, but my school gave them out so I listed it)\nEssays: Good (as far as I can tell, haha, I'm a little biased), I think they conveyed that I am passionate about government and life\nRecommendations: I got to read them for another thing and both were very nice. One was pretty basic but from a teacher who knows me really well and provided a lot of evidence to back up everything she said. Another was from a mock trial coach/teacher who has known me forever and was absolutely gushing, so that will probably be my strongest. My peer one was also very kind and from a very articulate friend of mine.\nI don't know if this helps any, but so far I have been accepted to U South Carolina, Boston University, Northeastern, Boston College, George Washington, American, and Emory. I got rejected from UNC Chapel Hill (essays were kinda weak bc I was not super interested). I was deferred from Georgetown early action and am waiting to hear from them, Dartmouth, and UPenn (obviously). All 3 are longshots but I was just curious as to other people's thoughts.\nIf anyone has any thoughts or wants to channel their stress by letting me know what they think that would be great.

Being a vocational school, I must spend half of my time pursuing a vocation; due to this, class-offerings at my school are more limited than the typical public school. Nonetheless, my school is a Level-One school (based on federally-mandated MCAS testing) and has a somewhat-elite acceptance rate (around 30%). Anyways, I took the SAT once and scored a 1350, yikes I know. I'll be taking the SAT again, and I plan on scoring 1400-1440. My unweighted GPA is a 3.83, and I'm ranked 10/345. I founded both the debate and finance team; I'm a member of the Math Club, will be a member of DECA and a I participated in SkillsUSA. I'm also going to participate in student government. Lastly, I ran track Freshman Year. I've always taken all-honors classes; my Junior Year is took AP Micro and Macro, and I received 5s on both exams. Next year, I'll be taking AP Stats and AP Government and Politics. Oh, I'm also a member of the NHS.\nI think I can get recommendations from my Superintendent and possible even my U.S. Congressman. I've been awarded some small awards, like Academic Excellence in Math, even though I'm not that great, at all. Unfortunately, I've only taken two sciences and I've never taken a foreign language. The only reason for two sciences is because three wasn't offered, and the reason for no foreign language is because my schedule did not allot time for foreign languages; I was forced to choose between an AP Class or a language.\nWhat do you guys think? What is weak about my application? What can I do to get into UPenn or any relatively-elite school, in general? Is there anything I mentioned that I should focus on in my application? What's the best way to get above study for the SAT, other than Kahn Academy and YouTube?

So I wrote about how much I cry... like I cry over a lot of stuff like AGT golden buzzers and when Shawn Mendes does anything. I first talked about how I was younger and I never felt like crying and gave examples of like when my childhood crush didn't like me back or when I scraped my knee I never cried. But then I heard about how in high school people cried every day and (basically wrote about all the high school cliches and how I thought they were all real) and I decided to run an experiment on myself to see how many times I would cry during my high school career. basically, I went in depth to two times when I cried when I dislocated my shoulder a week after I made the varsity team for softball and when I won my mock trial award at state. Then I basically finished with how tears are a sign of weakness but a sign of strength and my authenticity in the moment. I knew it was risky but I REALLY loved the idea and I knew I had to put myself out there. I kept it real light-hearted. I had my counselor, college counselor, like 12 of my friends, the oldest teacher in my school, the social worker everything and they said they never got any red flags when reading it. so yah oops that was really long.\nOther: math is not my strong suit, has never been.

In the mid of December, my best friend got accepted by UPenn. It was something he had been working for several years and therefore, he was incredibly happy to receive the acceptance.\nHowever, several days ago he was notified about withdrawing the admission due to the misinterpretation in the application. From what we could understand from the received 3 sentences, the explanation was far from the enough.\nThe thing is that my friend took National Examinations after graduating from high school due to the special Military Rule of our country. This Mandatory Military Service requires immediate military enrollment after graduating from high school unless a young man is enrolled at any local university. Just to clarify, he used the status of the student only as a formality to avoid the indicated service. This is something almost every young man willing to study abroad does as there is no other legal way to avoid the Military Service that lasts for a year on a daily basis.\nAs he considered this common practice nothing more than a formality, on the question \u201cIf you have ever taken coursework at a college or university, please indicate the number of colleges\u201d on CommonApp, he put \"0\". It also important to know that he has been working full time ever since.\nRight now my friend is not in the proper mental condition and this is the primary reason why I am posting this thread.

On Penn's website it states, \"Typically, more than 90% of applicants are offered an interview, depending on volunteer availability.\" If you didn't get assigned to an interview yet, it maybe because of the availability. You did say that \"(btw I live in PA, so we have a ton of alumus in the area).\" You may have a lot of alumni in PA, however that doesn't necessarily mean they have the time to interview every applicant. I agree that it may not be \"grades/score/stats\" related. You could try to reach an AO but it would actually be better to go ask the Undergraduate Office in person.\nb) This is what Penn says about interviews \"Yes. Time and again, Admissions Officers tell us how helpful the interview report is as they evaluate applicants. In addition, applicants say the interview strengthened their perception of the university, and increased their desire to attend Penn.\" According to Collegeboard, interviews are important. Furthermore, Penn says \"Please don't worry if you're not invited to interview. Since we aren't able to reach every applicant, not having an interview won't be held against you in our review.\"\nc) Conclusion:\n~I would recommend going to the Undergraduate Office and ask the questions you have. You could even call the University itself, or ask an AO like you mentioned. If calling on phone doesn't work, I suggest meeting in person.\n~Interviews are important in the Admissions Process, however if you didn't get one that doesn't mean you have no chances of getting accepted. Penn even said that the interview won't be held against an applicant if s/he is not able to get one. Therefore, don't worry. Again, the \"interview won't be held against you in our review\", Penn said.\n~The alumni might just be busy due to a lot of applicants. That is honestly the only idea I could come up with.\n~Just stay calm and relax. Everything will hopefully go okay.\nPeace!

If you think about it, where is the comparison to other applicants? How do admission officers have enough time to compare one application to the other thousands? Do applicants even get compared? These questions make me believe that applications do not get compared to others around you. I simply think that committees just look at your own application and determine the decision.

You have to do that when you have more qualified applicants than spaces.\nI think colleges with large applicant pools have to be constantly making comparisons as they try to assemble their optimal class with various buckets of attributes. Maybe there is an initial cut of applicants clearly not qualified based on objective measures such as grades, test scores and rigor of classes. But as the first readers go through the remaining app's they are either consciously or subconsciously sorting the remaining pool to decide which ones move forward.

I would say though that in the initial cut, it would be hard if not impossible for someone with an Academic Index (the formula using gpa and test scores for Ivy athletic recruits) below 176 (minimum for athletes, roughly a 3.0 UWGPA and 1200 SAT) to make the cut at highly selective schools The cut off is likely higher for other applicants, especially unhooked ones.\nThere are many reasons why a \"1600\" get's rejected and a \"1400\" gets in. The 1600 may have one or more of a low gpa, low rigor of classes, no quality EC's of note, lukewarm LoR's, poorly written and expressed essays and the 1400 may have had stellar all of those things. As outsiders, we can't compare because we can't see a lot of that information that the AO has.

For my other schools, I'd do East Asian Studies or Econ. I'd be targeting Japanese. I'm not fluent, but I'm for sure higher than college level Intermediate Japanese. Had a meeting with the assistant director of Huntsman, and he said it should be good enough.\nAcademics:\nwGPA: 4.6 I believe.\nSchool has no AP. Only honors or regular. I've taken almost all honors. I'd also be without a doubt #1 class rank wise. Go to a weird ass school that has no academic or extracurricular opportunities at all. I made most of the clubs at school.\nACT: 34. E: 36 M: 31 R:36 S:34\nUSH and WH SAT II: 720. A bit weak I know. Math II scores coming in tomorrow, and I expect anywhere from 760-800 on that. Also taking Japanese SAT II in November.\nTook APUSH exam for fun and got a 5.\nSchool is VERY small, so I know all my teachers and counselor there. They all love me, and I've seen the rec letters and they're fantastic. Showed my essays to a couple of people as well, and also got great feedback on them.\nExtracurriculars:\nSneaker Resell Company: I started a sneaker and streetwear reselling LLC 4 years ago, buying limited editions and flipping them. In one year, I have made over $36k in revenue, and decent profit. Been interviewed on some smaller websites.\nSneaker Blogger/Influencer: I started a blog about sneakers. I have interviewed prominent figures from companies like Nike, and get free stuff as an influencer from companies like Puma. I have readers from 30+ countries, and it's decently popular.\nSneaker Charity: I started a sneaker charity as well. I organize shoe drives and charity raffles in collaboration with charities for homeless youth, collecting 100+ pairs per drive. Coming up, I'm working with a large reselling platform to have a big charity raffle. Expected to raise anywhere from $30k to $60k if not more.\nFounder/President, Anime Club. Pretty self explanatory. Most popular club at school surpassingly.\nJapanese Translator: In my free time, I translate Japanese rap songs and write my own verses. I do translation for companies as well.\nStudent Ambassador: I assist in organizing all student trips/events at school. I meet with and introduce prospective students, giving guided tours with fun commentary.\nCommunity Service Club Head: As head, I've organized charity coat drives and fundraisers, including raising over $2k for Puerto Rico hurricane relief. Not as impressive as my sneaker charity lol.\nSquash Player: Silver-ranking squash player. Not good enough to get recruited sadly. I travel to tournaments and squash camps as a member of the Men's League at my racquet club. I also mentor beginners.\nJapanese Cultural Exchange Participant: I was one of 15 American students to participate in a cultural exchange program with 60 Japanese students. A lot of fun.\nSummer Stuff: Did summer classes at Columbia and business and finance.\nJust wondering how you guys think I stack up.
