I do want to be considered for admission. I do like UPenn as a school, but it was not somewhere I planned to apply until my dad coerced me to do so. When he did ask me to apply, I agreed and started writing the essay. I DID do it myself, but my dad very heavily edited (as he usually does) it. That's why I consider it \"his\" essay. He did not generate any ideas that were not already in the essay when he made me show it to him. Rather, he reworded it in such a way that my voice was lacking. Therefore, while every grain of my being is against the idea that my father should edit my essay in such a way, I still do consider my ideas to be present within it. Analogically, think of my father as a College Admissions Consultant, except in this case, a consultant who has no experience yet dogmatically claims he does. The consultant edits the essay deeply and sends it over. Although the basis of the applicant's essay is there, the consultant diluted it heavily. In essence, the essay does still include \"me\", but it includes my experiences, which I would easily be able to expatiate upon when given the opportunity. Thus, I do not agree with the idea that any terms of acceptance would be \"fraudulent.\" And as you may see, there is an inherent dichotomy.

I now presume what I'm looking for is the diction I should use if it is still a good idea to tell my interviewer about the situation.\nGiven your reply, I'll assume that the answer to that question is a big, fat, slimy \"NO\", the risk being I compromise my integrity if I don't word what I say correctly.\nLet me know if I am right in my understanding.

You would not be compromising your own integrity to do so, however.\nIn deciding whether to go forward and keep mum about remaining in consideration for a seat you have expressed no interest in having, a spot you have felt to be sought in your name but not by you, you must only answer for yourself whether you want the seat.\nWill you be able to reconcile that the application reflects some of you as you would be known (the facts), and yet was constructed through a process that removed the parts of you which you would have liked to be known?

Since the ACT tests college readiness, and I have done college math now, I will do better. Just assume it will be a 34-36? I will retake it, and trust me, I will get a 34-36.)\nGPA: 4.0\nLOR: 4 letters, each powerful and unique.\nOne letter by my HS counselor who knew me back when I used to sleep in a van.

I currently live in Pennsylvania and I want to apply to the Huntsman Program at UPenn. When I first discovered the program, I knew I would want to go here because it seems like a dream, studying languages, politics, and math, what else could anyone ask for? But I heard the program is SUPER competitive so I have some questions:\n1. Can you have 2 target languages? Preferably, I would like Japanese and French\n2. On the website it says that admission officers recommend taking AP Calc BC and AP Macro and Micro. If I continue with my current track, I will take AP Calc AB in senior year. Should I make taking AP Calc BC a priority? Also, my school offers AP Comparative Government and AP Macro for seniors but should I take both? I was planning on taking AP Comp Gov but AP Macro seems like a good fit too. If I were to take both, I would take one junior year.\n3. So I love learning Latin at school but it causes so many scheduling issues!!! Should I continue to learn Latin or drop it?\n4. My Stats:\nSAT: planning on taking maybe this year\nPSAT: 1230\nSAT II: Japanese with Listening (730) and planning to take more\nLanguages:\nKorean: taking TOPIK I and II\nJapanese: passed JLPT N5 and N4 and planning to take N3 in July in Canada\nFrench: studied for one year, going to take DELF\nSpanish: going to take AP and SAT II\nLatin: I know it's not a language but going to study 3 years\nWant to self-study Portuguese, Mandarin, Chinese\nBusiness:\nDebating whether to take AP Macro\nGoing to take SAT Math II\nGoing to take AP Calc AB (maybe)\n5.

I don't think its possible to study 2 languages AND be a Wharton student at Penn.\n2) If your school offers BC Calc, then you must take it. Huntsman's competitive enough as it is and if they saw you 'slacked' off in math then that wouldn't look too good. Same goes with AP Macro - you're applying for a business major, you might as well get some experience in the field.\n3) Like I said above, I think you should only focus on one language, whether that be Japanese, French, Mandarin, Portuguese, or Latin. From a Huntsman prospective, you should stay away from Latin. Any of the other languages would be great.\nMy own advice: Score high on the SAT (aim for 1500+) or the ACT (34+). You're going to have to take the Math Level 2 subject test as well. Be careful about focusing too much on languages. Remember, this is a program about business and international studies.

I don't think it's that admissions officers are holding aspiring students to a top level only status, rather its more of only passing along top or more qualified students to be on the directors' radar coming in because graduate students also participate in the ensembles and there is no separating undergrad from the grad students in the orchestra. There are some seriously talented students (and faculty) involved in the music programs.\nAnyone is able to audition for the ensembles and at that point the director would place the student in the appropriate level ensemble. A hs level player wouldn't need to be on the director's radar so to speak for several reasons, one being that a very large amount of admitted students are decent musicians but don't have the time to continue playing while at Penn and or the ones that do might need a few years more experience before being able to play in the orchestra alongside the high level grad students. - Thats my take from what my son has told me. Hope it s helpful or sheds some light?\nAnd just FYI, My son has \"raved\" about the top notch faculty in the music department. They are all the \"real deal\" and are a high level. If you are seriously interested in music, even if you aren't going to major in it in any way ...Penn has so much expertise to offer that will change you for the better. For example-\nMy son thought he knew so much about music from a lifetime of playing and training and took an elective class about the symphony (from Prof Bernstein it was about the ways in which this music conveys the composer's musical rhetoric to the listener). He thought it would be an easy \"A\"/ a gpa booster in which he could slide through... let me tell you he would spend 6 hours on homework assignments (willingly!!) listening and articulating what was happening in compositions bc he was so inspired and challenged.. The class ended up being a huge and challenging effort to get that A... but one in which he enjoyed every minute of it and that took his intellect to a new level. He can't give enough accolades about Prof Bernstein. If, you get in he highly recommends any music lovers to take any of his courses!!

No. The difference between the acceptance rate at Wharton and the acceptance rate in the College is about the same as the difference between the acceptance rate at Stanford and the acceptance rate at Princeton-- which is to say- negligible. And people on CC have been saying that SEAS now has about the same acceptance rate as Wharton. So unless you think that it's SIGNIFICANTLY easier to get into Princeton than Stanford (which, if you do, then we have more here to worry about than acceptance rates  ), you should just apply to the school at Penn at which you think your academic interests will be most completely met. So, once a student at Penn, internally adding a second degree isn't difficult, but today it is pretty equally hard to get into Penn's undergrad schools so one isn't likely to have the opportunity to add a second degree anyway.\nIt is not particularly common for students to pick up an uncoordinated dual degree (essentially, being admitted to Wharton and then adding a major from the College of Arts & Sciences) but it's certainly possible. More than the forms and the GPA, you'll just need an ACTUAL reason why your intellectual needs aren't being met in the school to which you originally matriculated and how the second degree will help you in your educational goals. I know students who seemed qualified on paper but were not permitted to pick up the second major because it wasn't clear that their curricular needs could not be met simply by taking courses in the different schools. I also knew students who seemed far less qualified on paper but had an outstanding reason about why they needed the second degree in marketing to supplement their degree in art history.\nIn all, the acceptance rates at Wharton, the College, and SEAS are so close that you should just apply to the program that you want to study in because your odds of getting in don't actually improve by applying to one over the other. At the same time, the liklihood of conveying passion about what you actually want to study goes up markedly when you don't have to fake it- so your essay about \"why wharton\" will probably be much stronger than your \"why SEAS\" essay if you actually care most about business and not engineering.\nFinally, I'm not sure about NETS but on their website it seems to indicate that dual degrees are not permitted with NETS- though I can't tell if they mean that students already enrolled in a dual degree cannot also join NETS or if NETS students are not permitted to have a second enrollment in the College or Wharton. http://www.nets.upenn.edu/how-to-apply -- my inclination is to say that for this program, dual degrees are not allowed.

Besides factors like being social and in a big city (which schools like Duke and Columbia have), what else about the undergraduate experience make it special? Or is it mainly the combination of these two aspects?\nAlso I've read that one of the unique things about UPenn is its really in depth dual degree programs. Seeing as they are even more competitive than the 9% admit rate school, I don't think I will get into any of these, so is it still worth applying?\nThank you!

As you mentioned one of the unique aspects are the coordinated dual degree programs. These are definitely unique and amazing program and is is true as you said yourself that they are very competitive to get in. There is a lot more to Penn though than these programs. These programs are a manifestation of Penn s wider focus on interdisciplinary education. The extent to which Penn has committed to interdisciplinary education is rather unique. As an undergrad you are free to take classes in any of the undergraduate schools and also in many of the graduate schools at Penn. Penn has the One University policy which essentially opens up opportunities for students across all different kinds of disciplines and schools at Penn. Also Penn does not have a core curriculum like Columbia for example, which allows more flexibility to build your curriculum and also to double-major, minor or do a dual degree.\nAnother think i really like about Penn is that that while the professors are some of the best researchers in the world and some of the biggest names in their field, they also take teaching very very seriously and are very available to students. Practically all classes at Penn are taught by professors most of whom are very accessible and available to connect with students outside of class during office hours. This is not something you find at too many major research institutions.\nAlso another unique aspect of Penn is the social life. Penn is known as the social ivy. I really like the variety of options you have at Penn. Greek life is big at Penn but also there are many other professional clubs, organizations, in which people are heavily involved and through which they socialize. Penn has a well-defined campus but it is also very hear the city center. So you have both house parties but also many frats and organizations organize events downtown at various venues in the city.\nFor me the things that make Penn special are the interdisciplinary approach to academics, the combination of practical/pre-professional and theoretical/ intellectual culture, the availability of really great research/recruiting opps for undergrads, the accessibility of the professors no matter how big of a name they are, the combination of strong social scene and strong academics and the clearly defined campus within a big (but not overwhelmingly big) city. Sure there are schools that have some of these characteristics, but the combination of all these is probably unique to Penn.\nOf course every top school has its unique characteristics that make it special and set it apart from others in some way or another.\nSo to answer your question yeah of course it is worth applying even if not to one of the dual degree programs. Fyi you can apply to one of the dual degree programs and put in as a second choice one of the four undergrad schools at Penn to be considered for admission in case you do not get in the dual degree program. Also Penn students have the chance to pursue uncoordinated dual degree programs.

Also the coordinated dual degree programs have dedicated offices and staff at Penn that provide extra guidance, mentorship with academics and internship/job search and also keep the alumni network very close-knit and organize alumni get-togethers frequently. The extra mentorship and the access to the close-knit, intimate and incredibly successful alumni network, are some of the reasons the dual degree programs are really special.\nFor a comprehensive list of the 9 coordinated dual degree / specialized programs check out this website: http://www.admissions.upenn.edu/academics/interdisciplinary-programs/earn-more-than-one-degree\nWith the exception of the VIPER and Computer & Cognitive Science programs (through which you get a BA from CAS and a BS from SEAS), if you want to pursue a major in SEAS and another in CAS then this is called a double major rather than a dual degree because it results in one degree either BA in CAS or BS in SEAS with an additional major from the other school (CAS or SEAS). In this case you only need to fulfill the general requirements of your home school and only the major requirements for the major in the other school. For example say I am a student in SEAS and I want to also pursue an Econ major in CAS. Then I have to complete the requirements for my engineering major and the general requirements of SEAS and the requirements for the Econ major, but i do not have to fulfill the general CAS requirements. In the end I will graduate with a BS from SEAS with two majors, my engineering major and the Econ major. For some reason Penn does not give the option to pursue a dual degree between SEAS and CAS, apart from the two coordinated programs mentioned before.\nOn the other hand, if a student who is in CAS, SEAS or Nursing wants to also pursue a field of study offered by Wharton, then the only option is a dual degree. This can be done through one of the coordinated dual degrees or though an uncoordinated dual degree. So in this case I would need to fulfill the major/concentration requirements and also the general requirements of both Wharton and the other school. In the end I would graduate with two degrees a BSE from Wharton and a BA from CAS or BS from SEAS or BSN from Nursing.\nHope this helps clarify things a bit.

Nowadays, many kids apply with 1400s to ivies and get in because of cool extracurriculars. They either win national debate awards, conduct research in labs, or obtain tough internships at political think tanks. Things like this are much more likely to get you into Wharton than a simple sat score. Next, your recommendations matter.\nThey don't want a perfect score student who is a rude person that never contributes to the campus at Upenn. In general they are looking to create a class of fun people who have interesting personalities - not study hard types that will never think outside the box. The only way to show this characteristic is by presenting a personality through the rec letters. I know many high scorers that get rejected by their dream schools.\nI am sure that you being an international also dropped your chances. Also, you never mentioned your gpa.\nTo understand why Upenn cares about subjective things instead of objective things like sat scores and gpa, one needs to understand the motives behind acceptances. Wharton wants game changers, They want smart kids who will become big bosses, CEOs, and presidents. They don't want employees - they want employers. This ensures that they can keep gaining recognition and fame. Upenn is successful. They know the traits of leaders - fun, smart, passionate, determined. Your SAT score alone will not reveal any of these things - that is for your essays, extracurriculars (ecs), and recommendation letters to do.\nGood Luck!

The coach probably already gave out his likely letters for the year. It sounds like he is worried that some of the kids on his likely letter list may not work out (usually due to AI). The coach and the admissions liaison then go down the list sequentially in order. It gets a little more complicated for teams with designated positions (like football, lax, etc), because then each position will have its own little mini-list.\nNow here is what I would recommend:\n1) Have your D send an email to the coach and ask when is a good time she can call him and catch up.\n2) The coach is probably more likely to divulge information over the phone instead of via email. Have a list of questions your daughter can ask. In particular ask very direct questions about how far down the list she is, how much support the coach is giving, and what % of kids in similar situations in the past were accepted.\n2) Calculate your D's academic index and post here.
