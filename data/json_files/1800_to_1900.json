In case you aren't familiar with the program, it's intended for non-traditional students - who are older than the average college student, or who have taken time off. I had a medical withdrawal from my university in Spring of 2015. I plan to address this in my essay, explaining how I had \"health issues.\" My health issues were severe depression and anxiety.\nLPS also asks about being a part of a group not traditionally recognized on college campuses. I was thinking about writing about being a disabled student and how this gives me a unique viewpoint to bring to the academic setting, etc., etc..\nThis brings me to my question - how should I deal with this issue on my application? On my regular transfer apps, I was hesitant to be forthcoming and just stuck with \"health issue,\" and never mentioned that I was disabled.\nThis brings me to the following questions:\nSince LPS is a non-trad student program, are the admissions committee more likely to be open-minded about these things? Should I disclose the nature of my issues to make for a more candid essay and picture of my situation? Should I write about being disabled as making me a part of a group not traditionally represented on college campuses?\nThanks!

Much like @sbjdorlo's son, you want your essay to show that you are college-ready and poised to prosper in spite of any impediments.\nBeyond that, take a step back from the essay and think about your readiness for Penn LPS itself. The reason an adcom will look apprehensively at any mention of depression is the same reason you yourself should be looking at it in the same way. LPS is by all accounts a difficult and demanding program. It is not Penn-Lite. Given the recent occurrence of your depression, it is a good time to ask yourself \"Am I ready now for a highly demanding program? Am I prepared to handle a relapse? If so, how?\"\nAs someone who dropped out of college due to depression himself, I have walked that path before. I urge you to keep the focus on yourself and your own preparedness for a rigorous program. If you emphasize your own health and readiness to return, then what to say in your essay about the gap in your education should come easily and naturally.\nFor me, treating my depression came primarily through meditation, mindful relating practices, and cognitive therapy. These things have not prevented relapse entirely, but they have significantly reduced the frequency and impact of relapses and the amount of control a relapse can take of my choices and actions. I feel depression and its intensity, but where before the depression would take the driver's seat in my psyche, now it is merely a backseat passenger.\nI took on those treatments in a piecemeal way, but there's now an integrated approach called Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy that is specifically designed to prevent and manage relapses of depression and anxiety. Completing a course in that modality, or one like it, could be a great way to build confidence (both for yourself and for any adcom) in your ability to manage future depressive episodes.

Most of the students I met were movers and shakers in their communities with a particular passion for something that they took to the next level...\nMany had start up companies, created video games, raised substantial $$ for a pet project, or had leadership or research or competition on a national level in their field of interest... I have read that admissions wants to know not only what you have done, but why you have done what you do, i.e. they want to see a cohesive picture of drive and leadership and what matters to you and what you will bring to Wharton.\nSo, I would say that while your leadership roles are great, now take them to the next level and intertwine them with what matters to you. Say- have your business clubs create a fundraiser to bring awareness and funding to xxx in your community or You say you volunteer at the YMCA- how about creating a new program for the YMCA- say financial skills seminars or business entrepreneurship seminars (I bet you could get local business leaders to donate their time) or organize your sports teams to hold tournaments to raise $ for the YMCA ... you mention that you are going to do science talent research- think about how that intersects with your passions, business goals and aspirations and combine it- Perhaps create a local business funded science talent competition or something...\nanyway just my thoughts on what you could do to distinguish yourself from other applicants... also never underestimate the power of a good essay!

I do plan on going to grad school, but perhaps after one or two years of working. Would I be able to get more real life experiences at Penn?

There is a dominant strain of pre-professionalism at Penn (I went there for grad school and interacted with scores of undergrads), BUT, what's notable about UPenn is the ability for different students to craft very different experiences.\nIf you want a nurturing environment, you can pick certain majors and certain communities (and avoid other ones), to gain that. There are certain college houses that are known for being close-knit. There are certain small majors that have a very nurturing feel.\nFurther, at Penn, you can explore a great city, AND you're not far from the suburbs. Want to experience a suburb and what's it like to be at an elite small college? Penn has the Quaker Consortium - you can take classes at Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford. (Each college is only about a 30 minute train ride from UPenn.)\nI should add: your ability to thrive at Penn will depend on your ability to drown out the white noise. Yes, there are many pre-professional students on campus. Yes, there are certain students (a minority, I think) who are competitive with one another, and yes it is a BIG school, and you'll feel that. And yes, during OCR (on-campus recruitment), campus gets a little crazy, and there's stress surrounding this for some students. If you ignore that, though, and focus on creating the community you want, you'll thrive. You can build virtually any type of experience you want at UPenn.\nOn the other side of the coin, Williams is more isolated, and it has a very specific type of feel, because it's so small. If you want urban amenities, they're a lot harder to get. If you want to take more of a \"real-world/practical\" class or explore that environment (e.g. taking a business school class or, on a lark, attending a simulation in a nursing school class), that's much harder to do as well.

You can't take classes in accounting or marketing or engineering at Williams.\nYou can do all those things at Penn, AND you could still take a bunch of classes at Swarthmore or Haverford College.\nFinally, you present stats demonstrating Williams' strength in placement. You fail to look at this, though, through a historical lens.\nFor a long, long time, Williams was undoubtedly a stronger school than Penn. It was more selective, had much better per capita exit options, was considered to be more prestigious, etc. Williams was really at the very tippy top.\nNow, as rural schools have fallen a bit out of favor, and small LACs in particular (without the benefit of strong, direct pre-professional programming) have decreased in popularity, the landscape is a little different. Penn in particular has gained from offering an array of professional programming in an urban area. Stronger students come to West Phila, and UPenn's placement is improving as well.\nA case in point: http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/20142015lawstats.php (usually about 10-15 UPenn grads go to Harvard Law a year), and, similarly, http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/law.pdf (on p. 159, 21 Penn grads are at Yale Law, compared to 10 Williams grads).\nPer capita, Williams probably still outdoes Penn, but the gap isn't nearly as large as it used to be.\nAs I stated earlier, if the OP can drown out the white noise at UPenn, it's an excellent choice.

She worked directly with the professor for several days, and then largely independently after that. The professor wanted a student with strong technical CS and math background to construct a very large database to make their research more efficient.

I guess when you say, \"Undergrads are the LEAST useful resource to aid in this endeavor\" it depends. This professor's grad students did not have the skills to construct the database they needed from scratch, so they hired her to create it.

There must be something I do not know. I was told by Penn and my D has confirmed that professors are required to teach their own classes, and that in practice that means that the professor can not delegate the teaching of undergraduate courses, and can also not delegate their office hours. The professor may send an assistant to guide the class through a review, but only if there is no new material being taught. Post docs and TA's are allowed to grade papers, and support students with homework help, lead a recitation etc., but they do not teach new material to the class.\nThis rule may not have been in place when you were there, or perhaps it is only the rule in SEAS, but that is the rule now. In the two years that D has been there, D has not had a single course that was not taught by the professor. Perhaps you can tell me more about your perspective.

In the numerous instances I heard of this happening, it was actually for the best - the professors were horrendous teachers/presenters.

The experience can very tremendously though. Much2learn noted that his d is proficient in comp sci, and there is a dearth of talent in this area - those skills are coveted, and those students get great opps. For those looking to assist by adding basic lab bench skills, these students are a dime a dozen.\nThe key at Penn, as I've said before, is for the student to be his or her best advocate, and to parse great opps from bad ones. What's written on a website may be very different in practice. Certain professors may honor the agreements, and others may farm work out. Similarly, some students work just for a recommendation, and others do truly vital work in labs. Moreover, admin offices vary in how much they can help. If an undergrad does research in John Epstein's lab (he's the chief science officer at upenn) - and undergrads can - you better believe that CURF admins would have no clout in convincing him to pay more personal attention to an undergrad. It's up to the student to be a good advocate and choose opportunities carefully. At small LACs, the feel is probably much different.

Perhaps it's hard to imagine for those that have never actually been an undergrad at Penn in the last decade-- but that's the reality of the experience. Sure grad students will do some grading in the larger lectures but they won't be in the lecturer's seat for the semester. And even if grad students do some grading, it has been my experience that professors usually do a final read-through to make sure they agree with the grad students' assessment. Lest we forget that the Penn grad students of today are the future Ivy League professors of tomorrow... But the actual teaching at Penn is done by professors for over 95% of classes and office hours are definitely with professors barring extenuating circumstances that would make a prof inaccessible at the listed time. In the School of Arts and Sciences, at least, Penn actually doesn't hire faculty if they don't want to teach- it's a literal requirement for employment.\nAnd yes, obviously one's research experience will vary from another's depending on the lab, the prof etc. etc. etc. That's true of any school. No university or college is going to provide its students with uniformly perfect undergraduate research experiences in practice.

That\u2019s pretty unheard of. We don\u2019t hire faculty, no matter how brilliant, who aren\u2019t interested in the teaching mission of the College of Arts and Sciences.\nIn the College at Penn, 95% of courses are taught by faculty, not by graduate students, so you will get to know your professors...And, by the way, when you do encounter a graduate student as a teaching assistant or instructor, you won\u2019t be disappointed. They lead discussion sections of large lectures called recitations and assist professors in grading, and grad students in the School of Arts and Sciences will be the Ivy League faculty of tomorrow, so many undergraduates find they are both knowledgeable and accessible.\"\nI don't know how Penn gives its grad students all of the advantages they need to go on to be great professors and yet they do! Penn's grad students are hot commodities on the academic market even though the undergrads will very rarely interface with them in a substantive way. A recitation here, an exam grade there-- sure! I think I had perhaps 3 teaching assistants in all of my time at Penn. I still keep in touch with one and she's enjoying her current teaching gig at Yale quite a bit.

Many classes at Penn have recitations on top of regular lecture times. These classes meet once a week and the purpose is for the TA to go over again the material that the professor went over in class and maybe also give out small quizzes and take questions. Grad students who are TAs also get valuable teaching experience from office hours, were students meet up with them individually or in small groups to ask questions and get help. Also they tend to teach some LPS classes and many summer courses. However not once in my experience at Penn have I had a class where the TA did the main teaching. It has always been a professor. On top of that, at least in my experience, professors also have office hours and are in fact very accessible to answer questions and help students deposited being very busy professionals. This has been an aspect that I have absolutely loved about Penn. It is a major research institution and churns out great volume and quality of research but the majority of professors who produce all this research really do care about undergrads too.

CS majors from Penn typically wind up with excellent jobs after four years, but the same can be said about many other schools. From what I understand, the program Penn offers is great but no better than any of the other great CS programs around the country.\nPaying for Penn can be a challenge if you are not getting help from parents and if your parents are relatively well off (FYI: retirement accounts shouldn't be counted for financial aid eligibility... check out some websites that tell you how EFC is calculated based on FAFSA for the real details). But it all depends. Let's say you live in California and get into Berkeley or UCLA - chances are, you would be paying far less at either of those schools than you would at Penn, and your mid-career earnings probably wouldn't justify the added cost. However, if you apply only to private schools with high price tags, you might be best off going to Penn.\nIf you want to get a sense of what your break-even point would be, let's try some back-of-the-napkin math.\nLet's say that your EFC is $45,000 and doesn't change over four years.\nPenn costs more than $45k, so if you go to Penn, that is what it will cost. Now, that $45k is based on your total expected cost of attendance, which includes some generous allowances for books and personal expenses. If we say you can save an extra $2,000 a year on those personal expenses, and if we say you can work throughout the year to pay an additional $5,000, that means you will be left with $37,000 per year to pay for four years. In this example, we'll simplify and say that your loans don't start accruing interest until you graduate.\nYour state land-grant university has a total cost of attendance (after scrimping and saving) of $30,000 per year, so you are on the hook for all of it. You put $5,000 toward it by working every year, so you are responsible for $25,000 per year.\nWhen you start paying loans, based on this example, Penn will have a balance of $148,000 while your state school will have a balance of $100,000. Your monthly payment for Penn will be $1,703.19 and for State will be $1,150.80. Over the course of the ten-year repayment period, Penn will cost $238,006.03 (adjusted for inflation), and State will cost $160,814.89. That doesn't tell us anything yet, though. We need to figure out what the total cost of Penn vs. State will be over the course of a career - in other words, because you had to pay that extra $550 a month for ten years, how much less do you have at age 62 than if you took the lower cost option? If we assume 3% inflation, the total cost of Penn by age 62 is $584,743.27, and the total cost of State is $395,096.80 - Penn will have cost $189,646.46 more than State.\nBefore you freak out about a huge number like that, remember that it is a big number but over the course of a lifetime. The average CS major starts out at roughly $62,000 a year (based on USA Today's analysis); if we take an anonymous State university, we can assume you will make roughly the national average. Penn's 2015 CS graduates reported an average of $98,000/year for starting salary; now, there is a little selection bias there, so let's say that if you include the people who didn't respond to the survey, let's assume the average is $90,000.\nUSA Today reported that CS folks basically get a 2% average annual raise over the course of their careers, so the average CS major will earn a total of $3.6 million in their 40-year careers; using that same math, the average Penn CS major will earn a total of $5.4 million in their careers. This means that the average Penn CS grad will earn $1.8 million more than the average State U CS grad. Based on this math, it will take 6 years for Penn to pay off against your average state university. In other words, by the time you are 28 - before your loans are even due to be paid off, Penn will have been a better choice for you.\nNow, there are a lot of assumptions there, not the least of which is the assumption that you will go directly into a CS-related field after college. If we change the calculus and say that you will only make $10,000 more out of Penn than you would at a State U, and if we say you live in a state where your land-grant university is free for in-state students, then you would essentially break even over the course of a career. Further, it's a dangerous game to think about lifetime earnings. Your student loan payment is incredibly meaningful when you are in your 20s - your investment may pay off handsomely, but if it requires you to live in fear of job-loss (think: a $90k salary with $1,700 a month in debt service means you are paying almost 40% of your post-tax income; bump that salary up to $120k and the debt becomes a more manageable 28%), it may not be worthwhile to you.\nThis is a major exercise in risk/reward and cost-benefit analysis. Only you can decide what debt load is appropriate, and you won't know the details of your debt until you have gotten into the schools and gotten your financial aid awards.

There are a lot of things to consider when deciding between these colleges. For me it all depends on how much aid I will get from Penn. If the retirement account is not reported (Which it doesn't have to be; as much as I'm aware from reading the FAFSA verification guide) I will be paying around 5-10k a year for Penn because the only other money my parents make is from Social Security (which isn't very much). Also the reason why I\u2019m set on Penn instead of Berkeley or UCLA is location. Location is key because I can\u2019t afford to live In California as much as I love the state. Penn is in my home state so it would be more practical. I agree with your analysis; even if I got an inferior aid package from Penn it would still pay off after 5-6 years assuming I land a job around the real average (90k a year salary). So far it looks like Penn is a no brainer if I can go there for 5-10k, but I will have to wait for regular decision because I can\u2019t take that kind of gamble with financials. Because I will face tougher admissions chances, I am trying to get my ACT up to a 34+ which should be a huge admissions boost.

That would mean that your hypothetical starting salary difference is only about $5,000, which is pretty darn small in the grand scheme of things. Then consider that pay increases are not linear (my example assumed they were, for simplicity, but the reality is that they are not). If you are talented enough, the pay disparity you might encounter when you start could essentially disappear within two or three years as your company recognizes your work.\nIf you are only on the hook for $5-10k a year in EFC, then a top tier, high-endowment, private school may actually be more affordable than a public school - where those top tier private schools have policies that you only pay what you can afford, with the rest covered by grants, some public schools won't offer that kind of aid except through merit scholarships. It is, therefore, possible for Penn State to cost more than Penn. And, realistically, if you are taking $15,000 or less in loans every year, you won't be strapped financially when you finish anyway. If you have to take out $50,000 in loans every year, then it's thinkin' time.

Depending on your personality, some downsides may seem more or less severe. I think UPenn's worst aspect may be that it can be hard to retain a perspective on reality and your life as a whole. i.e. It can be easy to fall into a sort of \"UPenn bubble\" mentality once you arrive here. There are a million opportunities here but they are not as easy to know, grasp, and attain as you might think. Not only courses and clubs, but even social life is rigorous. TIME FLIES--you'll be very busy here.\nHowever, there are many great things about Penn as well (I'm sure you already know these). I know I gave a lot of complaints, but I would say I'm happy here and continue to feel shocked, grateful, and immensely lucky for the day I received my acceptance letter. I want to be frank in saying it's not ideal, BUT don't want to deny the fact that Penn is an amazing institution worthy of being a dream school. If you come here and find yourself rejected from all the clubs you applied for, use your extra time to explore the city or attend talks and symposiums. If you have trouble connecting with others or don't meet many people you like at first, spend your alone time productively by reading academic journal articles on topics that interest you--there are a lot of articles on fun, pop-culture and other related topics that you won't have at your fingertips once you leave college. And if your grades aren't what you want them to be, don't lock yourself in the library--instead, think about what ELSE you can prioritize to give yourself a potential/real edge over those with higher GPAs.\nPenn's pre-professional environment discourages you from majoring in so-called \"useless\" topics, but there is no such thing as a completely useless major. I brushed this kind of advice off when I was younger, but it really is true: Pick a major that you both enjoy and are very good at. A philosophy degree (just as an example) from Penn can get you jobs in many non-philosophy fields, so long as you have the relevant extracurriculars (clubs, competitions, internships, self-study) (or relevant electives). Studying what you love is what will showcase your intelligence more than a degree in something you are ambivalent about. These are what will make you stand out to employers more than the name of your major.

While I was in grad school at Penn, I interacted with scores of undergrads, and I was always amazed at how \"in motion\" they all were. They were always going from class to some meeting to another activity to studying to something else.\nStudents can carve out almost any type of experience at Penn - there are pockets of Penn that are competitive, with students competing against one another, in inpersonal environments, for clear-cut professional goals. There are other pockets that are much more collaborative, with nurturing relationships between faculty and students. What seems to be the common thread amongst all these experiences, though, is the level of activity present across the board.\nThis was entirely different from my undergrad experience at Chicago, where there was a lot of emphasis on deep thinking and long, long conversations with people. My fondest memories of college were the numerous dinners in the dining hall that lasted for three hours, with students just sitting and talking. This just doesn't happen often at Penn - students are too busy with activities to just hang out for hours on end, everyday, for weeks at a time. Moreover, unlike a LAC, opportunities must be sought and gained - they don't just fall into your lap.\nThis level of activity can have adverse consequences, especially when it's coupled with a frail advising/support system. Penn students can feel like they're on a treadmill, and everyone is in motion around them. Further, the advising/mental health support wasn't as robust as it should be. This is improving, but there's been some serious consequences on campus (e.g. suicides) in the past 4-5 years.\nSo, to students considering Penn, it's a great place if you can drown out the white noise and if you're confident about YOU and what YOU want. Students that are good advocates for themselves, are purposeful and thoughtful, and don't let external activity encroach upon internal aspirations/goals, can thrive at Penn. Those who \"float\" however, sometimes are startled when they see where the stream takes them.\n(For those who want to float, btw, I think LACs are a great choice - lots of nurturing, lots of resources to help you unpack what you want and how you want to grow. Some medium-sized research Unis, like Brown and Chicago, do a pretty good job of this too, but their efforts here may be ebbing.)

Sure, there are laid-back students and more languid individuals, but for the most part, UPenn culture is about the buzz of activity.\nFurther, it's sometimes hard for young people to block out the white noise and NOT go with the tide. If everyone else is off at meetings and activities and extra curriculars, it's hard to be the outlier. And, most Penn students keep their schedules very packed.\nAgain, this has adverse consequences. Just ask any of the counselors in the Penn mental health office (CAPS) - the pressures here are very real, and a significant subset of the students definitely struggle, no matter how selective the school has become. (Some even say the increased selectivity makes everything even more intense on campus - the screws are turned even more, so to speak. Every year, applications to different clubs grow, and the atmosphere of constant activity only increases.)\n(Side note - I was unfamiliar with the need to \"apply\" to be in a student group. At Chicago, there were more club spaces than there were students, so you could just sign up for any club you want. At Penn, some clubs are quite selective and hard to join. The expectations in some of the clubs are quite high as well.)\nAgain, can you be a laid back student at Penn? Sure. Can you avoid academic challenge at Chicago or Swarthmore? Sure.\nA dominant strain can exist, though, and students should be cognizant of this.

There was also difficulty getting into smaller seminars with popular professors, but once I started getting into the 200-level courses and above, I never had any issue with scheduling.

You describe exactly the sentiments I heard from so many UPenn undergrads. They always seemed to be \"on the go,\" or on the \"treadmill,\" and it wasn't rare to have 45 hours of academic commitments AND 45-60 hours of extra-curricular commitments a week. (For most people, that makes for a very busy week!)\nThose that genuinely loved being on the move and bouncing from one activity to the next thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A subset were exhausted and disheartened by the treadmill. The important point to note is that it's not for everyone.\nSimilarly, @Much2learn - what you describe is exactly why Chicago isn't for everyone. If you don't want academics to be front and center, where you might spend hours and even days at a time studying, and most other people are doing the same, it's probably not a great place. For others, it's a perfect place. (The overall intensity at Chicago has almost certainly ebbed, though, and the fit there is more flexible now too.)\nTo contrast chrisw's post with my own Chicago experience: over a 7 day week, I probably spent about 55-60 hours on academic matters (classes, reading, work), and then maybe 10-15 hours on extra-curricular stuff. This left a LOT more time for just hanging out, having long dinners, kicking a soccer ball around with friends, etc.\nNote, I raise all of the above because top research Us now try to appear to be everything to everyone. This just isn't the case. Yes, fit can be flexible at medium or large-sized Us, but dominant cultures certainly exist.

If anything, Penn was one of the most accessible, approachable elite schools, as far as I could tell. Sure, there's elitism, just as there is at any top school. For the most part, though, given its size, its scope, and the vast array of student aspirations and inspirations, it wasn't overly elitist, as far as I could tell.\nA case in point, Penn has students studying nursing, marketing, accounting, communications, insurance management, etc. These aren't traditionally \"elite\" fields, and, especially at the grad school level, it draws people from all over. Look at the house staff at a college house - there are graduate advisers who come from everywhere, and they are accepted and beloved in their communities.\nI provide two counterpoints:\n- When I was at Yale visiting a family friend, I ran into a lot of Yale Law students, and I was amazed at how many went to Harvard or Yale for undergrad (or Oxford or Cambridge), and the whole place had a much more \"elitist\" feel to me.\n- When I mentioned my intention to go to Penn for grad school to some of my fellow Chicago alums, one sniffed and said, \"you mean the state school ivy?\"\nThere are certainly instances like the above two at Penn, but, for the most part, I at least didn't find it to be elitist in the way you describe.\nFor me, the common thread was how \"on the move\" and over-scheduled the students were, not how elitist the community was.

Have you ever had the opportunity to visit, explore the campus, and meet some actual students?\nLet's unpack that string of misinformation.\n1. \"UPenn is know for having an extremely elitist community, much like Harvard\"\nIn my experience, the Penn student culture tends toward practical doers who are team oriented, hands-on, and sociable. They like what they are doing, and develop relationships with others who do also. Acting elitist does not fit well into that model at all.\n2. \"There are many trust fund babies who didn't do much to get in.\"\nThis happens a lot less than people think. I don't actually know any of these. If you want to call President Gutmann and ask how much it would cost to get in as a development case, I would guess it would be at least $10 million, and probably more. Not many people can just write that check.\n3. \"There is also a huge drinking culture.\"\nThere is definitely a drinking culture on the weekends. Whether it is worse than other schools, I really do not know. However, the amount of work that is required of students means that it is more limited than at many schools where parties rage on every day. That does not happen at Penn.\n4. \"Grade deflation is the sauce of major stress and depression. \"\nI don't think Penn has grade deflation or inflation. Cornell, Princeton and Columbia (SEAS at least) seem to have lower grades. Harvard, Brown, and Yale seem to have higher grades.\n5. \"Also, the weather and location isn't the best- cold icy winters and in the middle of a relatively dangerous part of Philadelphia.\"\nWeather: It isn't Hawaii, but it is the best weather in the Ivy League and much better than Cambridge, Hanover or Ithaca.\nPenn students like the big-city, Philadelphia location and do not feel unsafe there at all.

If you study physics or chemistry in books, but never going into the lab, does that mean you are \"not intellectual?\" If you actually do some writing instead of just reading books about how to write, does that mean you are \"not intellectual?\" Of course not.

I took many (many many many) humanities courses at Penn and in all of them we were having the deepest conversations possible on a college campus that often spilled over into coffee shops, college houses, and dining halls. There is no forced, pseudo-intellectualism at Penn as I found at several other universities I visited. There was a very real and honest conversation about the ideas that have shaped the world. Penn offered all of the intellectualism with about a quarter of the pretension of its peers. So yes, there were kids spending hours over dinner chatting about Sartre and there were kids eating sushi as they walked down locust walk to get to their next meetings. And there were those that alternated between the two lifestyles depending on the day. The dominant culture at Penn is certainly pre-professional; But it never comes at the expense of the intellectual. Pre-professionalism serves to keep the campus grounded, self-aware, and keenly cognizant of how the ideas we were discussing might one day play out beyond the ivory tower. It is a different brand of intellectualism-- but no less valid than that of other universities.\nOne of my History profs had previously taught at Columbia and would often wax poetic about how Penn's curricular flexibility and 4 separate undergrad schools were real boons to the liberal arts because you didn't find a ton people bogging down a humanities course because they weren't interested in the reading or didn't see how it would be applicable to their future. Penn provided resources to those with more practical interests without ever sacrificing the depth or breadth of resources available to those with more 'ornamental' interests, as Benjamin Franklin might have put it. The professor found that schools like Columbia have very lofty ideals of what an education *should* consist of but in practice they do a disservice to their students by forcing them all into understaffed humanities courses taught by grad students without clear departmental direction, regardless of interest or dedication. At Penn, students are rarely just collecting A's-- they are unimaginably passionate about their school work, in part because they aren't forced to fashion a finance degree out of a combination of Math and Econ classes or an engineering degree in the science departments. If those are their interests, they can go pursue them and they do so zealously. If their interests fit more comfortably among the more abstract areas of academia, then they'll have a home at Penn too. Yes, all students can join Wharton clubs and take philosophy and engineering classes-- and many choose to take advantage of those opportunities. But those opportunities don't dilute the very real intellectual force that runs through all 4 of Penn's undergrad schools.\nAnd let's not forget that professional schools can be highly intellectual as well. It is none other than the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania that has the most published b-school research faculty in the world. Research is being done in every corner of this university and even the most practical schools have faculties and students that are supremely dedicated to intellectual pursuits even if they are sometimes filtered through a pre-professional lens.

Did you find that there was a preponderance of those high school types motivated by chasing A's instead course/discipline content?\"\nHmm... I wouldn't say that Penn isn't an \"intellectual\" community. Really by definition, any school - especially any college - is engaged in an intellectual enterprise. In this way, Penn is no different.\nI would say, that from what I saw, Penn didn't have a large collection of future academics in their undergrad student body. NOTE, by academics, I mean those either currently or aspiring to be a scholar, or professor, at the higher ed level - essentially anyone planning to make a life in the ivory tower. So, I define the term narrowly.\nI think the culture and the types of students selected actively play against the possibility of having lots of budding academics present in the Penn undergrad population. Training to be an academic, and being an academic, requires the very sort of imbalance that Penn (institutionally and culturally at the undergrad level) frowns upon. It requires devoted, intense, and singular study - often in isolation and while grappling with difficult problems - in ways that don't mirror what most Penn students do or want to do.\nWhat I saw at Penn were students who were involved in all sorts of things. Their classes/learning was a part of that, but extra-curriculars played a big role, as did social enterprises. They then learned all sorts of skills through their varied pursuits. In contrast to this, most academics have a fairly narrow skill set, and devote most of their energies to fairly myopic areas. It's hard to find a history professor who also is an elite coder or runs a fashion blog. Being a history professor takes too much time and energy to focus on much else.\nIt's much easier to find a Penn history major who's great at coding and also is heavily involved with a fashion club on campus. That same history major is unlikely to give up all the other cultivated interests to focus singularly on the intense (and sometimes isolating) study of history at the graduate school level. That same history major may take her coding skills (honed through hours in her extra-curricular work as a coder for various clubs) to a tech company after graduation, where her writing skills and awareness of the importance of narratives - something she learned as a history major - will serve her well on the job. It's quite unlikely that the history major would forgo all this to get a PhD in history - her Penn experience didn't really make a PhD the next natural step. It could happen, but I think it really only does for 3-4% of the undergrad population. (As opposed to say, 15% of the Chicago population, with, at least in my day, another 5% beginning some elite PhD program and then dropping out.)\nTo sum, when people ask if I think Penn is pre-professional, I say that the UPenn education AND experience is great preparation for the world outside the ivory tower. (There are some undergrads who chose to stay in the ivory tower, but they are a small minority at UPenn.) This doesn't mean that it's pre-professional, but the academic/ivory tower isn't as revered at Penn, precisely because that life requires a type of imbalance that is anathema to most Penn students.

Same goes for SCEA, albeit to a lesser degree. There's an administrative cost to this. More time would be spent on recruitment, and if the U is suddenly going to receive thousands more applications, they'd need to increase the size of the office. Further, the yield would almost undoubtedly drop, which is not a favorable outcome.\nMoving to SCEA or EA would mean a modest drop in accept rate (lets say, it goes from 9.4% to 8.4%), and a slight drop in yield (let's say it goes from 69% to 67%). Further, it'd take a lot more administrative work to keep yield high and review more applications. How is this worth it?\nI've written about this in the Chicago forum, but the two key reasons for Chicago's admissions success are:\n1.) Outside of the super-elites (Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT, and Princeton), Chicago has a lot of pre-existing academic strengths, AND is buoyed by the big investments pouring into the college. (Over the past ten years, the school's spent probably $1B+ on it's medium-sized college. It's also taken on a ton of debt to build a lot during the great recession, so it was more aggressive than other schools recently.)\n2.) The school has poured a LOT of money into its admissions department/public relations wing. I've posted this on the Chicago forum too, but Chicago's Admissions Dean Jim Nondorf probably makes around $600K now, and he has a TON of resources at his disposal for marketing, wooing students, hiring staff members, etc. If you pour money into admissions, you'll see results. I just don't think Penn's Admissions Dean Eric Furda has been given the same level of resources, and he certainly doesn't make $600k a year (that'd make him one of the U's highest paid employees). Also, pouring more money into Penn's Admissions offers little return - it's certainly selective enough as it is.\nPut another way, Chicago's institutional priorities right now may be a little different than Penn's. Chicago's President, Robert Zimmer, seems to have targeted selectivity as something he wants to drive down to the realm of the super-elites, and he's invested a ton in this. (Zimmer's invested in other areas too, of course, but College admissions/the state of the college seems to be high on his list of priorities.) Penn, on the other hand, isn't doing this, and frankly, I don't see a need for it.

Penn has over-admitted this year, Eric furda said it himself, there will be more than 2445 students enrolled. Here is how i calculated it:\nThere were 3661 students admitted both ED and RD. Of these, 1332 were accepted ED. With an overall yield of say 68.5%, we have 2508 students enrolled. So Penn over-admitted this year. Lets assume that ED yield is 100% (actually never is, more like 98-99%). Subtract the 1332 EDs from the 2508 overall enrollment and you get 1176 RD students enrolled. RD students accepted were 3661-1332 = 2329. 1176/2329 = 50.5% RD yield. Now if the actual yield is above 68.5%, the rd yield goes up, also if the ED yield is less than 100% (will almost def is) the RD yield also goes up. Teeing into account the slight negative effect of summer melt on yield, I think there is good chance that the final yield is over 50%.\nThe way you calculated is goes an overall yield of 2445/3661 = 66.8% which is not what the actual overall yield was this year. This is because you put the target class size as a constraint while it really is not.\nI agree with the point about the administrative burden, hadn't thought about this. Chicago definitely invest exorbitant amounts of money and energy for advertising and admit courting etc.\nAlso I don't think Chicago is as selective as MIT or Princeton. Acceptance rate does not equal selectivity. Chicago, through its EA program jacks up applications by quite a bit hence the 11000+ EA apps it receives.

While in other posts I usually say that she is a CS major for simplicity, for your question I will specify that she began as a CS major, but subsequently switched to NETS (http://www.nets.upenn.edu). The two are closely related.\nMichigan has about 30,000 undergraduates compared to 10,000 at Penn. Furthermore, Penn SEAS students can and do many things in addition to traditional engineering, so it is entirely possible that they have not run into Penn grads, just as they may not have run into Harvard grads. It is also possible that they just don't know the Penn grads.\nPenn has many of its graduates working in the tech industry from CAS, Wharton and SEAS. One particularly notable example they might know would be Elon Musk.\nDD is leaving in a week for her San Francisco internship at one of the largest tech companies, and rejected multiple offers for this summer. I think that is very good for a sophomore, and almost all of her friends have similar opportunities. Freshman summer she worked as a research assistant and took a math class on campus.\nIt is true that many Penn students don't go to graduate school right away. The reason is that in an economic environment where about 50% of college grads can't find a job using their degree, the average SEAS grad has two offers, and they are very good ones. I saw that the average new graduate salary for NETS graduates last year was over $100k, and CS is close behind. Many of these Penn students will decide to continue on the graduate school eventually, they just often have great opportunities to get some great work experience first.\nAlso, some Penn students pursue graduate school concurrently with their BSE. DD is considering sub-matriculating into the MS in CS. It appears that she can probably even complete it concurrently within the 4 years if she decides to do make it a priority.\nI hope some of that information is helpful.

I personally did my research and Penn Engineers are doing well for themselves even in tech, and there's even this program called Penn Tech Trek, where participants go and meet 5 prominent personalities in the Valley! I think Penn will be my choice!\nBTW, how is your daughter finding her classes? Does she get to know her professors and how are research opportunities for undergrads??

Silicon Valley recruiting probably works hardest on the west coast but it's not that hard to find a job someplace worth working if you're articulate and quantitative. While IB is definitely over-represented, alumni magazines are making it pretty clear that people are moving into tech at a good clip as well. If I had to choose, my salient points would be cost, location (urban vs college town) or size (medium-sized vs large). Finally, there are great tech jobs everywhere beyond Silicon Valley. I already mentioned the PNW but Denver/Boulder, Austin, NC, and Boston have numerous companies as well. SV is more relevant if you want the startup scene but it's widely perceived that startups are in the midst of a correction as no one's going public and acquirers are getting smarter with their money (why do an acquisition when you can out wait the VC and do a zombie acquihire for a fraction of the cost?).

As you go south, the safe areas push west... at Chestnut, it was just fine out to 42nd. At Walnut, it was safe out to 44th. Locust - 45th, Spruce/Pine - 48th, Baltimore - 52nd; I am unfamiliar with Woodland so can't talk about that too much, but I presume it's pretty safe since U of the Sciences is in the area.\nThe difference at night between the 5000 block of Market and the 5000 block of Spruce is astounding, and the difference between the 5000 block of Spruce and of Baltimore is equally astounding. You'd think you were in different cities.\nIn terms of more general things, when as you go northeast of campus, you step into Drexel's campus and surrounding area. If you go straight north, you slowly exit the university areas and get into trouble. If you go west along Walnut, it gets comparatively less safe as you go; if you go southwest along Baltimore, it gets less safe as you go, but it takes far longer to get to that point. To the direct south is the Penn medical complex, followed by the Schuylkill, so there's nothing really there. To the east is Center City (if you walk east on Walnut Street, you'll eventually wind up at Rittenhouse Square, which is one of the safest areas of the city). Campus and the areas with high numbers of students surrounding Penn/Drexel/USciences are all exceptionally safe, with multiple layers of security that give you a sense of security without seeming overbearing.\nI have nothing but respect for the Penn Police, whose directive is explicitly to keep students safe. Unlike rural college towns, where a not-insignificant portion of their revenue comes from fines to students for underage drinking, Penn Police has no such incentive. If they see you intoxicated in public, their first concern is to ensure that you arrive home safely and will take you to the hospital - no questions asked - if they suspect you are in trouble. The PALCB has brought enforcement officers to campus during the big drinking weekends, but, for the most part, parties only get broken up when something dangerous is happening, and it is pretty rare for people to get cited for underage drinking.\nThere are plenty of things I didn't like about Penn (and plenty more that I loved); security was one that I always admired, respected, and appreciated.

Thank you \nHello. I'm a student who wants to apply LPS or ordinary course.\nFirst of all, I love this kind of curriculum. Because I love studying generally! I want to major in Computer Science. However, besides CS, I want to study various things -- such as Education, Psychology, Business, Math -- in World-Class level. Therefore when I knew about these courses -- GS, Cornell College of Arts and Science, and UPenn LPS -- I was so happy.\nI'm a programmer, and I have 3 years of work experience -- before I work in a company, I worked as a freelancer -- and was CTO of startup. We did good. We got good value, made good product.. but I quit to study. And I really want to see the big world and learn lots of things.\nFurthermore, I'm a senior at domestic high school in South Korea. I worked full-time after I finish the school. And I quit the job 7 months ago to focus on study.\nTherefore I took AP exams -- predict scores are 5 on Calc BC, 4 on Mechanics, 4 on Microecon, 5 on MacroEcon, 5 on Stat, and 5 on CS --\nTook ACT -- current score is 30 but think i can do better on next sitting --,\nI have quiet good ECs -- school CS club founder and president, school book debate club founder and president, got few prize from Korea government, VP of a group that consists of Korean students who love Science and Math, and so on. I did many things.\nI volunteered in my way -- I made a website of NGO and making a service for homeless or unprivileged people.\nAnyway, my dream schools are Stanford or Harvard, but I know that I'm not good enough to get in Harvard or Stanford because of my score. However, in case of Cornell, LPS, or GS, I think I could give it a shot.\nTherefore I have three questions.\n1. Is it a good shot for Cornell, LPS, or GS?\n2. The reason why I'm thinking about LPS is broaden course. I have heard that LPS has more broaden course. Is that true? If it is not, there is no reason to apply LPS..\n3. Can I apply to LPS? I have heard that I have to take a year or more break to apply LPS, but I did not took break and I don't want to.\n4. Is there is many discrimination in LPS honestly? I really like to be hang out with experienced people --because they are more mature --, but I do not want to miss my campus life tho.\nThanks in advance.

Nothing really to mention... the curriculum was cool since there were no courses that everyone was 100% required to take, allowing me to avoid classes I knew I had no strength in, but I still got a relatively broad survey of coursework in my time.\nClasses: Too broad of a question. I took 32 classes at Penn, and they were all unique in their own way. You will have large lectures with 250+ people in them; you will have seminars with 10 people in them. Some professors are excellent, but others are mediocre.

It sits at the heart of Penn and no university offers more interdisciplinary opportunities to its undergrads than Penn. Classes are generally small and in fact there are only 5 classrooms on campus that even fit more than 250 students and only 10 that fit over 100 students so the vast majority of your classes will be much smaller.\nProfessors are all pretty outstanding. Penn has the highest percentage of full time teachers of all the ivies and thanks to the one university policy, professors in almost every school and research center on campus (including the graduate and professional schools) are accessible to you as an undergrad. Professors are also doing groundbreaking research pretty much across the board at Penn and opportunities to work with these professors and to even get published with them are plentiful.\nThe required classes encourage you to get a broad education without ever limiting you in studying and exploring your areas of interest. They also offer a very large number of courses that satisfy each requirement and the class styles vary widely so that you can take classes in subjects and environments that meet your intellectual and academic preferences while still gaining exposure to ideas and concepts outside of your comfort zone.\nPenn has a strong balance between the intellectual and the pre-professional sides of education, allowing you to emphasize whichever aspects of either that most interest you. While there is definitely more of a pre-professional atmosphere at Penn, it doesn't come at the exclusion of the intellectual atmosphere- instead both complement one another in profoundly enriching ways.\nPenn's compact yet specious-feeling campus in the heart of America's 5th largest city and the USA's only World Heritage City (Philadelphia), also allows you to enjoy the traditional college experience with plenty of grassy quads and Collegiate Gothic architecture while never being more than a 15 minute walk from middle of one of the most vibrant urban centers in the world. With opportunities to intern in the city and to enjoy all of the culture, art, food, and fun that Philly has to offer, it is easy to fill your weekends and evenings with opportunities off campus. The relatively close-knit campus community and the overabundance of campus activities, however, tend to keep students on campus most of the time and fully engaged with campus life. Penn allows you to create your own balance between the city and campus that works best for your personal living style.\nHousing at Penn is also great and getting better. Penn's college houses have only improved with time and the New College house promises to transform undergraduate living in a meaningful way. The traditional Quad college houses are beautiful examples of Collegiate Gothic architecture while the high rises provide for a more apartment-like feel to your undergraduate living experience coupled with beautiful sky-level views of Philadelphia. Off campus housing is also outstanding, very cheap and incredibly close to campus. Most students who live off campus (which is a little less than half of the undergraduates) don't actually live off campus in the traditional sense at all. Instead they live in luxury apartment complexes or beautiful, converted Victorian homes within a block or two of the campus. The land is often owned by Penn and merely rented out by other companies. It's a great option for students looking for greater independence and cheaper rents.\nAt the end of the day, Penn will be what you make of it. It is entirely possible to have a wholly average experience there. If you were to take advantage of all of Penn's vast resources and the incomparable opportunities inside and outside of the classroom, however, you might find that Penn offers an exceptional education unlike any other.

These are both outstanding schools and you definitely can't go wrong in choosing either one. I chose Penn over Georgetown back in the day even though I also really like DC.\nFirst of all, the most important part of college is the education. If Penn has your major and Georgetown doesn't, that's something to definitely keep in mind. Also consider the incomparable strength of Penn's communications degree. You will be working closely with Penn's Annenberg School for Communications, one of the best Comm schools in the world. Penn ranks at or near the top of pretty much every Comm ranking and the scholarship coming out of the school is extremely well regarded. Additionally, if you change your mind about your Comm major, Penn has similar programs to your other areas of interest as well.\nI would not say Penn is a particularly cutthroat place. It has the reputation of being very intense but I wouldn't say that manifests in a negative way. Peers are constantly pushing one another to excel but they're supportive of one another. Students are always eager to form study groups and share notes. And if you choose to focus on Political Communications, I know for a fact your fellow students will form a pretty tight bond over your four years as those students routinely work very closely with one another and with outstanding faculty members like Professor Eisenhower (Dwight Eisenhower's grandson). Penn is definitely high intensity in the same way Georgetown would be, but I don't think it has an extra edge of competition that you wouldn't find anywhere else.\nOnly 25% of Penn undergraduates join a fraternity or sorority. The vast majority of students find their social lives revolve around extracurricular activities, their College Houses, the library and more. You are also within walking distance of the heart of Philadelphia. I love Washington D.C. and I genuinely think it's one of the best places to live. At the same time, however, I think Philly is the perfect place to go to college. Penn's campus is big enough and self contained enough to give you the traditional, ivy league experience while Philly is exciting enough to encourage kids to 'leave the penn bubble' and get into center city. Having spent a lot of time in both cities, I can tell you that DC is cleaner but philly is more fun. Both have great art, architecture, and public parks. Philly has way better food and a significantly more laid back, relaxed vibe. In general, however, you'll spend most of your time with friends on campus doing the things that work with your personality. Georgetown is also kind of removed from the heart of DC and transportation to the area is intentionally not great. But there is a bus you can take and I think georgetown runs shuttles as well. But Penn is far more integrated with Philly and Philly is far more accessible to Penn students. The College Houses all host events for their residents and friends of their residents, and extracurricular clubs all host parties and have fun events. One of my favorite memories from freshman year was attending a BBQ with a cultural group on Penn's campus to which I had no affiliation. It was open to the whole undergraduate student body and the food was incredible. These experiences are what will make up the majority of your social life if you aren't looking to be involved in Greek Life at all. And even if you don't join a fraternity or sorority, you can still attend their parties and get invited to their Formals. At Penn there are enough students with enough varied interests that you will definitely be able to find your group. Maybe that's in a cultural center, or student government, or a varsity sports team, or a music ensemble, or the Philomathean Society, or among tutors in West Philly-- the possibilities are endless.\nIf you have any questions about Penn, please feel free to ask. I general, I chose Penn because I felt it had the best combination of incredible academics, a beautiful urban campus, an incredible, world class city, and a social, laid back atmosphere in which I felt supported and encouraged to do my best. I think visiting both campuses will help. Good luck with your decision. I hope you choose Penn!

I'm a current Penn student who had the tough choice between Penn and Georgetown (International Relations at Penn or SFS at Georgetown). Ultimately I chose Penn and I'm very happy with my decision. If you're looking to do anything media or film related I would definitely recommend Penn. Not only are the academic programs in the communication strong, but there are a lot of extracurricular activities (Gregory Film House, student clubs, screening groups) you can join. I know lots of students here interested in media in different ways, and Penn has provided them with great opportunities to explore their interests.\nI wouldn't say Penn is cutthroat. It's not an easy place, but the reason a lot of people are stressed out here is because they're doing way more than what's required for them. Apart from my first-year calculus class (which doesn't seem like you would have to take anyways), all the students I've been around are highly collaborative and helpful, just busy. Also, Penn is a really large school and Greek life only has to dominate your social life if you want it to. Otherwise, there's so many students you can get involved with whatever you really like. Personally, I went to a frat party once, decided I wasn't interested, and never encountered another one anyways because there are already so many social activities to participate in.\nAlso, Philadelphia will be a great city if you're interested in the arts! There's so many different forms of arts you can explore here, and they're much more affordable compared to DC. There's the orchestra, with highly discounted memberships for students, the International House, plenty of concerns venues, film festivals, local artists. Honestly there's so many things I can't think of them all.\nAs for opportunities, Penn has many, especially for internships in DC. Personally I've gotten to go abroad 3 times because of Penn. If you want to do something, Penn will likely have a program or an advisor that will help you do it. Also, DC isn't terribly far away from Philly, and if you want to visit there, it's a pretty inexpensive bus ride (as is NYC).\nI hope some of this helped answer your questions about Penn.

In the CS world I know, Penn isn't considered as high as that top tier. Is there a different teaching philosophy? Smaller class sizes? What makes it more rigorous?\n\n\nPenn offers an academically more challenging experience than Stanford, based on what Stanford undergrad friends have willingly told me and based on my own experiences. I define this in terms of how challenging the courses are. It's true that Penn has less grade inflation than most schools, but even ignoring this, I straight up think the courses are harder at Penn at the undergrad level. I agree that Stanford might be a better place to do a Ph.D in a lot of fields, but there's a massive difference between what undergrads and Ph.Ds go through. Stanford core undergrad courses have been watered down these days, according to my friends who went there. And this makes sense when you consider just how many people at Stanford take those classes every year.\nThis is absolutely true with regards to Harvard, too. I think Cornell is at an equal level of rigor, based on what I've heard.\nIn my experience, tier lists generally focus more on things like brand name and researchers, rather than undergraduate program rigor.\nOverall Penn is probably a very solid choice for CS, but I'm skeptical that it offers more rigorous or quality CS than Stanford and some other big names.\n\n\nI think it makes sense that accepting my claim requires a leap of faith. There's no way to quantify academic rigor. I think that rigor is orthogonal to research prestige and brand equity. For example, you could easily take a calculus class at a local community college that is more rigorous than one you'd take at an Ivy League school.\nI think the point I was trying to make was this:\n1. I think you would actually learn more at Penn than some of the traditional \"top\" CS programs due to the intensity and expectations of the undergraduate courses.\n2. Job placement is basically equal.\n3. You should therefore be confident in picking Penn for reasons other than CS strength, which coheres with what other posters have mentioned.\nI'll be honest here: I'm obviously a biased source. I loved the hell out of my Penn CS experience, and I feel like its program is underrated, so I want as many people as possible to consider it. And given that one might actually learn more here than at a \"traditional\" heavyweight CS program, there's almost no downside (assuming that one is a good cultural fit for Penn). Case in point: I have many friends who turned down CMU SCS for Penn SEAS.\nHope this helped people understand why I made the claim I did!

So I'm also understanding of the grad vs undergrad experience.\nTo add in one point: I think that grade inflation isn't always a bad thing. One of the reasons I think it is very common in top schools is because it is aimed at easing the stress of grades and encouraging a more learning for the sake of learning environment. It really depends on the students - others benefit from being pushed to get that A- by working incredibly hard. In my experience, difficulty isn't always correlated with how much you learn.

Beyond these required tests, we recommend two SAT Subject Tests in line with the student\u2019s academic interests. More details on the new policy can be found on our testing webpage.\nWe changed our policy for a couple of reasons. Our research suggested that the essay portion of these exams did not add to our understanding of students\u2019 ability to succeed at Penn. The subtle differences between writing scores didn\u2019t relate to any meaningful difference in performance at Penn. Most written assessments at Penn and other universities provide ample time for students to think, research, reflect, write, edit, and revise. This reflective writing process tends to yield the most thoughtful and best results.

The most important thing to remember when writing any essay is that you should always 1) create a thesis that answers the prompt (it's okay to restate the words of the question in your thesis in answer form if that helps you keep a better focus of the end goal) and 2) make sure your evidence and commentary relate directly back to the thesis (ask yourself, \"How does this statement prove my argument to be true?\"). Make sure you have AT LEAST two points, but three is even better.\nIf you can do that, you're three-quarters of the way to a good essay. The rest lies in the rhetoric, how you present your argument, and its validity or lack of fallacies.\nAlso, because, of the time limit, try to keep your essay concise and to the point. You can leave space between paragraphs if you want to add some details in after you've finished initially.\nDon't doubt yourself! If you truly believe what you are saying and can effectively communicate your points,your essay will shine! I wish you the best!\n(P.S.

As the previous posters mentioned you will need to hit a target AI that the coach will give you and the minimum the ivy league will allow is a 176, which is approximately a 3.2UW gpa and 1650sat. Never fear, if you can't make those numbers and the coach still likes you there may be an option to do a PG year at one of the well know prep schools for another ~$50k. So figure out the details for your sport, think about (or ask your coaches) where you fit in ranking wise in your sport and think about whether you want to be a division 1 athlete.

Nevertheless, I'd say that you should apply to Huntsman if u are up for the challenge. Many people who ik were rejected from Huntsman or other dual degrees still got into Wharton (not dual-degree). Best of luck! I'll be applying to Upenn in 2016/2017 as well!

I don't think it is the MBA acceptance rate since this has historically been quite higher than 13.9%. But nowadays Penn's acceptance rate is 9.4% ( not 9.9%) so the Wharton acceptance rate is most prob around 7.5-8%. The Huntsman program is super competitivenes and its acceptance ratceis most open in the 5-6% range ( no one knows for sure though). Apply to Huntsman and then put as you second choice either Wharton or CAS. Keep in mind that it is much easier to do an uncoordinated dual degree with CAS as a Wharton student than the other way around. So if you don't get into Huntsman and put Wharton as your 2nd choice and u get into Wharton then at the end of your freshman or sophomore year you can do an uncoordinated dual degree with CAS as long as you have above a 3.0 . However if you get into CAS and then want to apply for a dual degree with Wharton you will need to have at least a 3.4 to even be considered and even then it is not certain that you ll be accepted since it is a quite competitive process. Seems a bit lopsided and it is imp but that is how it is. So if you are open to the idea of pursuing an uncoordinated dual degree between Wharton and CAS if you don't get into Huntsman, my advice would be to put Wharton as your 2nd choice, not CAS.

Also keep in mind that Wharton is relatively self-selected, since not so many kids wanna study business straight out of high school. So Wharton tends to attract those kids who already know for sure what they want career-wise.\nI wouldn't say Wharton is significantly harder to get into nowadays, but prob slightly harder. The dual degree programs at Penn (M&T, LSM, Huntsman and also Vagelos, VIPER) are definitely significantly harder to get in and in general you can tell there is a difference between these students and the rest of Penn.\nSEAS has become increasingly selective over the last few years and the outgoing dean of SEAS even claimed that SEAS has become the most selective school in his farewell email, but he didn't give any more statistics to back this up so who knows how true it is (prob isn't true tho...).

This is what drives the ED acceptance rate so much higher. For a non-legacy, non-athlete student the advantage is small, if any. Not necessarily. You don't have to have started a business or interned at a top company to get into Wharton, although there are many students who have done either or both before they even set foot at Penn, but they are not the majority. Most Wharton admits are just traditional, very accomplished students who have had meaningful involvement in extracurriculars and have taken leadership positions in them. The ECs don't even have to be business related and often if they are not, it could be a plus because Wharton values diversity and you'll stand out this way. They do want to see leadership though. I know people at Wharton who were very STEM focused throughout their high school career but decided end of junior year they wanted to go into finance. They had ECs like head of robotics club, or math club etc but nothing finance specific.\nAlso, another point about difference between Wharton and non-Wharton. I guess the key difference is that most RD Wharton admits do not even consider other non-HYPSM schools, whereas there are non-Wharton (CAS, SEAS) RD admits who turn down Penn for schools like Chicago, Columbia.

Of course there are students who turn down HYPSM for Penn but if you look outside the dual degree programs at Penn the probability of that happening goes down dramatically.

This has not been my experience at Wharton. The majority of Wharton students who applied RD were rejected from all or some of HYPSM. There is a small number that turned down Yale, Princeton, MIT and even maybe Stanford but it is the minority. Very very few Wharton kids were accepted at Harvard. Of course Wharton has many students who applied ED and many of whom could prob have gotten into some of all of HYPSM.\nThere is just that general perception that people have when they first come here that HYPSM is a bit superior.

Statistically speaking the majority of RD applicants were rejected at one or more of HYPSM. Also I know a few people who applied ED in order to increase their chances of getting to an elite school, even though Wharton/Penn was one of their top but not their 1st choice. At least this is what I have seen from my experience at Penn.\nIn my time at Penn the vast majority of the people I ve met who have turned down HYPSM have been dual degree kids.\nOf course there is a significant part of the population that applied ED because Penn was their absolute first choice, not denying that, and that says a lot about the quality of the school.

So more like 7.5 -8% would be my estimate, but it is definitely lower than the other schools at Penn for sure. Also Wharton is somewhat self-selected which could contribute to a slightly higher acceptance rate than one would expect. For M&T, Huntsman,LSM the acceptance rates are prob between Harvard/Stanford and Yale levels. Also I don't entirely agree that Wharton is looking for different kinds of people that HYPSM or other top schools. Yes there are the kids who have already built businesses and are super pre-professional from high school and know they wanna do finance, but most Wharton admits are simply very accomplished students just like anyone else, with a general interest in business, and leadership positions in high school.\nWhat @Canoon describes happens more often than not both during RD and ED. People apply to Penn for CDDs and put wharton or the other school (CAS or SEAS depending on the program) as their second choice. If they get into CDD there is good chance they have also got into one or more of HYPSM and in this case the split between Penn and HYPSM is rather even, with many, maybe most (def not all though) choosing the CDD. The students however that do not get into the CDD but instead get into their second choice at Penn, for example Wharton , then the chances of these students choosing Penn over their HYPSM option(s) goes down significantly. For SEAS the only case I have heard of is people turning down Yale because its engineering is not as strong, and for CAS the chance of that happening is even lower.\nOf course I am not saying that this is what everyone does, but if one looks at the aggregate I am willing to bet that these are the trends one will observe.

I've heard from those on other posts that Penn's CBE program forces you to take up to 5 Core, Math/Science courses within a semester (which apparently \"not even MIT\" does). When I visited Cornell, which is also known to have one of the most rigorous engineering programs, the MechE students advised me to take 3- at most 4 core classes per semester, in order not to overstress myself or murder my GPA. I used to think that Penn offering concentrations within the major was a real plus, but maybe this is because most CBE majors are too overloaded with required classes that they have no space for even a minor (I'm guessing that a double or dual major is out of the question at this point).\nMy courseload in high school was meh.\nJunior year - AP World History (lots of work for this class), AP Physics C, AP Calc AB\nSenior year - AP Bio, AP Chem, AP Calc BC, AP Psych (easy), AP Lit (easy)\nI don't put in as much studying as I should. So I tend to feel that I only find classes particularly difficult and consuming because I wait until the last minute to do assignments or seek help. Given that in College, I'd have more free time that I'd just have to manage, is going to Penn for CBE still a good choice?\nI enjoy challenging myself, but my family is putting A LOT of money into this decision, so the number one priority for me is putting myself in the best position for finding a job.

Most Penn SEAS students are very involved in multiple activities, but you have to know when you need to hole up and focus on classes. One good thing is that there are many engineers around you who are working just as hard as you are.\n2. Keep in mind is that class can vary substantially in how time consuming they are. DD had one project-based CS class was literally taking 25- 30 hours of effort per week by itself. Clearly, you can't take two classes like that in the same semester.\n3. Most Penn students had nearly perfect high school grades. Do not expect that you will keep a 4.0 gpa at Penn. The average is about 3.4, but that is in a class full of students like you, so the average grade is a lot lower and the competition is a lot tougher. Some students enjoy being in classes with peers for the first time, while others struggle to accept that they are not the best student in every class any more.\n4.

Also in general in terms of academic quality, prestige there is not really any difference between the two. I think your decision will probably come down to fit. Fit in terms of social life, the curriculum, location, and just general vibe.\nIn terms of job outcomes Penn does incredibly well, in fact it is overall the most-targeted ivy by firms along with Harvard and has the second higher salary, employment statistics after Harvard. Also Penn was ranked #1 for social sciences by payscale, which looks at salary potential. http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-majors/social-sciences\nIt terms of social life, no ivy can really beat what Penn is offering (it is not known as the social ivy for nothing). What I like about Penn is that people are very driven and on top of their work but also know how to party and have fun. You dont have to be a hard partier or join greek life to have fun at Penntho, there is something from everyone, from the really hardcore types to the really mellow.\nPenn is in a big (but not overwhelmingly crazy) city so there is access to many bars restaurants etc but there is also a well-defined campus with many things to do inside. At Penn there is a campus feel and community whereas from what I have heard Columbia is lacking that because New York is so overwhelming and the campus is so tiny. Some people find New York too much as college students others really love it. I personally think New York is too much for an 18-, 19-year old.\nColumbia has a rigid core curriculum (many requirements) whereas Penn is very flexible and encourages a lot of interdisciplinary study. Both are attractive to different people for different reasons. Consistent with its commitment to interdisciplinary study, Penn makes it easy for you to double major and take classes even in many of its professional and graduate schools.\nI think both schools are pretty diverse but I get the feeling that Columbia is more to the left of Penn in terms of economic views and Penn I think gives a slighlty wealthier vibe than Columbia.\nTry to visit both, talk to alumni etc to make an informed decision.

So I asked a friend at Annenberg and she said that there are a few non-trad students from LPS sitting in many of her classes (both at Annenberg & the College). A few of them are *extremely young* to be non-traditional students to the degree that she, at first, thought they were from CAS. Those young non-traditional students tend, no offense, not to be very smart. However they are an older LPS man who studies like a powerhouse.\nI checked the LPS website and basicaly they are saying that: LPS students get exactly the same degree. Wow. I am aware of Harvard Extension as well but they kinda take in everyone. LPS seems like they have an admission process. I don't know what is the big difference but IMO it is obviously easier for students to get in via LPS. However once they are in (if my friend statement is true) then they are subjected to the same standards with us so it will be very difficult for them to get OUT (graduate) if they are not up to the standards.\nSo basically getting in via CAS is like getting a real job. You have more financial assistance, and very rarely you can go wrong. But getting in via LPS is like taking an unpaid intern. You stay only if you are good enough to keep the job.\nIf it's so then Penn is such a great school offering second-chance opportunities for people. Frankly spoken, I am kinda skeptical about the quality of an LPS student but if that person makes it to graduation with a degree. I would say that he/she is on par with other students at CAS. If an uncapable young guy want to get in Penn via LPS as a backdoor, he will fail. It only works for older people with a real goal. Penn designed it like that. Tsar, it's up to your situation. If you are an older and nontraditional student, you might consider that a good option. Otherwise, don't cheat the system. It's gonna bite you hard.
