So you would need an undergrad degree first before you ever received the hands on business training that you will receive from Wharton as an undergrad. That right there would make me look no further...... at Penn in Huntsman you are graduating in 4 years with both a BS in Economics from Wharton, and a BA in International Studies from the College of Arts and Sciences.

It can be lonely place if u dont have any buds to chill with especially for freshman (its why highly recommend that freshman avoid the high rises since its mostly upperclassmen) Unless ur an engineer, the high rise buildings are close enough for all of your classes, great room sizes, AC, and great proximity to the frat parties and bars. The only other negative aspect of the high rises are that you'll have to leave the building for food, which can become trouble during cold winter months, but the walk isnt too far to the 1920 commons.\nIn conclusion for freshman I would rank the dorms as follows:\nHill, Quad (very close second; consists of Fisher, Reipe, & Ware), Dubois, High Rises (Harrisson, Harnwell, Rodin), Stouffer, Kings Court\nI'll create a more in depth view on each college house in a few days but i hope this helps ", "user_id": "132709", "user_name": "jskillz ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "35"}, {"date": {"month": "January", "day": "21,", "year": "2009", "time": "10:30PM"}, "comment": "\nMayer Hall easily has the best rooms on campus (I live there, currently, as a senior). The rooms are *huge*, and they have AC, carpet, kitchens, bathrooms, furniture, etc. Our elevator is also crazy fast, and seeing as we only have like 7 floors, it's great. The building is also located near frat row/the High Rises/Stouffer/the Quad/Huntsman/the restaurants on 40th/Frogro/etc, so it's a really great place to be. It's also really hard to get a room here because priority is given to the Stouffer Hall residents. Stouffer is where I lived for my soph/junior years. Anyways, if you're a freshman, getting a room in Mayer is difficult, but not impossible. Regardless, Mayer is mostly full of upperclassmen anyway, so you're probably better off elsewhere.\nI also lived in the High Rises during my summer stays -- both Rodin and Harnwell. They're both pretty comparable in quality to one another. They're not as social as the other dorms because floors don't \"hang out\" with one another, unlike Hill where you can basically see all other floors from the lounges, haha. Some rooms have carpet, and others tile. The closets are pretty sub-par, but I believe most (if not all) rooms have a kitchen and bathroom. The elevators are fairly annoying and like to break down often, so be wary of this. On the good side, though, I've been to a lot of really fun social get-togethers/parties in the High Rise rooms. The view you get from the higher rooms is pretty much unmatched, as well. I wouldn't advise freshman to live here, since it's mostly full of upperclassmen.\nFor freshmen, Hill is probably good if you're either an engineer and/or wanting a good social experience. I lived there freshman year. Hill is pretty bustling, although the rooms are basically jail cells. Hard tile floor, mad dust accumulations, no AC, fairly shabby communal bathrooms, poor lighting, etc. However, you have your own dining hall, which is quite convenient... until you get a bit tired of eating the food there. It's also located near DRL, which is great for engineers. But, in general, people are always spending their time jumping in and out of each other's rooms/the lounges/the hallways, so it's really easy to get involved in Hill.\nI never lived in the Quad, so I don't know too much, there, but they are a popular freshman choice, and they're located very close to many buildings where freshmen typically take their first courses.\nAs for Stouffer, it's a mixed bag. There are a TON of single-rooms in Stouffer, but unfortunately it tends to promote antisocialism if you're not careful. My group of friends always got out and chilled in the lounges/ventured off into the city/hung out on campus, but sometimes we'd come across people we had never seen before, and later find that they lived in our sections, but just never left their rooms. Other than that, though, the rooms are decent. Carpeted, air-conditioned, and with reasonably good communal bathrooms/showers only shared between like 4-5 people (since each pod, or cluster of rooms, gets access to its own bathroom). Each room also has a pretty good closet system. Stouffer also has a huge community-oriented feel, but you can be as involved or detached as you want to be. There are many, many events held frequently, which are always announced through the Stouffer listserve. Stouffer is also located above Wawa/the barber shop/Gia Pronto/Beijing/The UPS Store/Savory, which is very convenient. Stouffer's a good place to live as a freshman, especially if you want a leg up when it comes to getting into Mayer later.\nGregory is just kinda... weird. The halls are dark and depressing.

The only good thing about it initially was that it wasn't Hill! He hated Hill when we went on the tour [as did I], so even though he did not get the Quad like he had hoped, English House has been fine. It's actually better looking on the inside than the outside.\nAlso, his room in KC English House is huge, has one whole wall that is glass overlooking the courtyard, and it also has a sink in the room, an added bonus. Cons about the room however, include the noise that travels up from the courtyard at night, all hours, when he's trying to sleep or the maintenance people very early in the morning emptying the trash cans outside as well in the same area. The dorm itself seems very clean and people quite friendly.\nI've just started college touring again with my middle son, and this past week went into a 'typical college dorm room' at a Massachusetts liberal arts college. It was so small it really freaked me out. Made me appreciate again how big my older son's dorm room is at Penn. We've been to dozens of colleges overall, and I can't say we've ever seen the 'dorms like palaces' that they speak of on princetonreview.com or elsewhere. Haven't really seen any freshman dorms that were very nice inside, so looking for amenities might be the next best thing, like sinks, 2 windows instead of 1, sprinklers, good temperature management or ability to open the windows if it's too hot/cold, distance to classes, lounge areas, camaraderie in the dorm, etc.\nBut in the end, if you get into the school of your choice, where you sleep seems a little less important.

A lot of students steer away from it because it is dedicated to African-American culture but the rooms are really nice. They offer singles w/ bathroom, double w/a bathroom, triple, with bathroom kitchenette common room, and quads with the same features as triples. It's easy for freshman to get in b/c not many appy for it. All freshamn get triples. Unless you're in a residential program freshman are housed on the west wing of the fourth floor so you'll be around your peers. It's the smallest dorm on campus both in size (4 floors) and residents (~160), so there's a sense of community. There are no elevators and no A/C so the first couple weeks at school are pretty bad. It' closest to frat row and all the parties, FRoGro, CVS, and the movie theater Rave. It's furthest away from classes though (10-15 minute walk). The closest dining hall is 1920s Commons food is okay my favorite is downstairs (Starbucks, Burger Stop, Grocery store and Subway) They all take dining dollars.\nHill- I nicknamed it Hell but it really isn't that bad lol. If you're an engineer or just hate walking definitely live here. It is the closest dorm to about 90% of the classes you will take. There is no A/C either so first few weeks are pretty bad. They offer singles and doubles but both are pretty small. Roommates can literally lie on their beds, stretch out their arms and touch each other. I do, however, like the layout. The rooms surround a main common room and kitchen and are divided by colors and streets. They are arguably the closest dorm on campus and if you're a freshman and worried about making friends it'd be a qood choice to live here or the Quad. In my opinion, Hill dining hall has the best food on campus so it;s nice to have it at your fingertips. It's also close to Houston Hall and shops on Walnut like CVS. It's the furthest dorm from all the parties, unless you're going to Drexel.\nQuad- ahh the infamous quad. There is no way I would live here (hate shared bathrooms and bedrooms) but it is quite beautiful and nicer than Hill. It's made up of Ware, Fisher Hassenfield, and Riepe and they're all pretty much the same. There are singles, doubles, and triples with one bedroom and a common room. All rooms have A/C but the layout is really luck of the draw. Some rooms are bigger than other (5th floor Ware is ridiculous) and shaped differently, it depends. It's mostly freshman which again is great for meeting people and the fact that it's closed in makes it one of the safer dorms on campus. The location is nice as well. It's closer to classes then campus proper (High Rises, Du Bois) but closer to parties than Hill. It's also near Wawa if you need a late niqht coffee run. Most athletes (well BBall, Football) are housed here and the majority of them have singles next to at least one teammate.\nKings Court/ English- In my opinion the hidden gem at Penn. One of my friends got stuck here but she likes it now. It's two houses- Kings Court and English but they are joined together with a nice courtyard in the middle. One of the safer ones as well. English is the better of the two but most freshman live in Kings Court. It's basic doubles but they're a lot spacier than the Quad (my friend has a walk-in closet!) I don't know that much about English house. The dining hall is arguably the best on campus but closed on weekends. The location is kind of weird, it's tucked away past the bookstore. It's close to Cosi and Urban Outfitters though and in the middle of the extreme directions like the Quad.\nHigh Rises- If you are a freshman who wants apartment-style living but don't want to give up the freshman experience APPLY TO FRESHEX (freshman experience). It's housed in Harrison and all my friends LOVE it. They get really close and I always see them out together. It's I think 5 floors of freshman residents with a RA. There are triples and quads with a bathroom, kitchen, and common room. All of the high rises are like this with singles and doubles as well (all have the accommodations mentioned earlier). Even if you dont do FreshEx, if you're a freshman and apply to a High Rise you won't be isolated. Harnwell doesn't have a program but all freshman who get in are housed on the same floor. Rodin doesn't accept freshman. The location is same as Du Bois close to all the parties and Commons but far from classes. Also, after freshman year all your friends will be scrambling to get rooms in the high rises and you'll have the upper hand, being a former resident you get points the longer you stay there. This means you get preference over everyone else.\nGregory- Correction: This is the furthest dorm from classes, it's at the very end of campus. A couple of my friends live here and they have nice rooms. Triple with a bathroom an common room I believe. Besides that I dont know too much more. Pretty anti-social I've heard.\nStouffer/ Mayer- These are the only dorms I've never been inside. Unlike KC/English though they are two SEPARATE dorms, Stouffer is next to the Quad closer to the High Rises/ Du Bois side. Mayer is across the street and down a little bit.

I think I'd like to enter Bioengineering or Chemical Engineering. I'm interested in research in drug delivery, bio-sensors, biochemical engineering, nanotech, and bio-materials. Not so much prosthetics, tissue engineering, or medical devices. I'm not sure that entering industry is the best choice for me, since I'd like to be involved in research. I'll probably pursue grad school.\nI was accepted into Cornell, Upenn, Northeastern, and Univ. Maryland.\nGot no finaid from all except Northeastern (for which I'd have to pay a little over half tuition). I don't live in the state of Maryland. My family can afford all colleges, but I'd like to pay my parents back for at least half or work while studying to defray the cost.\nI loved both Cornell + Upenn's Campuses. Northeastern felt kinda small, but I enjoyed the cities of Philly and Boston. Even though Cornell was in a rural setting, the campus is very charming, and Ithaca commons has a nice vibe ^^ I haven't visited UMaryland.\nIf students or graduates from these schools could chime in about some of the following concerns, I'd really appreciate it!\n~~~The average GPA for CoE students @ Cornell is ~2.9/3.0 Kids have said that employers will be understanding of Cornell's rigor, and that employment will not be an issue because a Cornell Degree opens a lot of doors. First of all, is this generally true? Anyone who had a GPA under 3.0 have experience with this? Is that policy used for Graduate School, too? If I can manage my time well and seek help from fellow students and Profs/TA's, do you think it's worth taking the risk of throwing myself into a highly competitive pool of students?\n~~~How rigorous is Penn Engineering? Probably just as hard? Is grade inflation just as non-existent?\n~~~Penn offers a \"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\" major, whereas the other schools do not. They may offer \"Chemical Engineering\", and I'm sure all schools offer concentrations within ChemE for bioeng, but would the \"Biomolecular\" tag associated with Penn's degree be a big benefit for me?\n~~~Northeastern, Penn, and UMaryland all offer \"Bioengineering\", whereas Cornell only offers either \"Biological Engineering\" which seems to be more related to agricultural sciences (?) and \"Biomedical Engineering\", which I don't think fits my interests all that well...\n~~~I've heard that there are opportunities (though highly competitive) in research to receive grants that cover one's whole grad-school education at various universities around the nation. All schools offer good research opportunities, but will any give me a greater chance of securing these grants/fellowships? Are there grants which are given to a greater # of students, as well as those that are reserved for an extremely select few?\nThank you all so muchhhh!

It's true you want to minimize debt because law school can be expensive but the reality is that Penn and the other Ivies place significantly better into the nation's top law schools than anywhere else. in 2014, Penn had 22 grads heading to Harvard Law, 20 to Columbia Law, 12 to NYU Law, 11 to Penn Law-- and those are just the students who chose to matriculate. Many more students get into these schools and turn down those offers for more scholarship money at lower ranked law schools or a strong school in a specific field or geographic market. A place like Penn gives you an advantage at every step (which is essential in a field like law where jobs have all but dried up for those outside of the top schools). You are just assumed to have the credentials before you walk into the door. Whether that's fair or not is another question but it's reality.\nBut in terms of politics (and honestly lots more jobs than many would like to admit), having the pedigree helps. Will it make the difference between a good application and a bad one? Nope. But it still matters. If you're one of five kids at UIUC in your program then you'll probably be assumed to be as smart as someone at an Ivy.... if they read your application. Some recruiters even outside of wall street and finance just use computer programs to search resumes for the names of these colleges and nothing else. Then those applications are chosen for an actual review. The real world is, perhaps unfortunately, not like a holistic review in a college admissions office. Rightly or wrongly, colleges are expected to have done most of the holistic reviews for the employer and then from those universities, the employer can choose whomever they feel fits the culture best. They risk the possibility of passing over an amazing applicant from a school without the 'name brand' but they save the resources it would take to sift through all of the applications they get. This is obviously particular to very elite positions to which many people apply and only a few can be chosen. For less intense positions, the 'prestige factor' plays less of a role usually- but that's not to say it doesn't matter at all.

If you are considering law school, please, please, PLEASE don't acquire a lot of debt as an undergrad. The reason a lot of UPenn undergrads go on to good law schools is precisely because UPenn has a lot of high scoring LSAT takers, with high GPAs. That's it. If you have a high GPA and a great LSAT, you can get in anywhere - disregarding where you went for undergrad. Law school admissions is much more numbers based than, say, MBA admissions.\nA couple years back, a top law school forum compiled the data of undergrads with the highest average LSAT scores. Take a look:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z7FPSt2L1Qc5dYDPhwoFfldl3mTZRZ8dI7-n2gN9f8E/edit?usp=sharing\nPenn is in the top 15 for schools with the best lsats/gpas, only behind schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc. It's no surprise, then, that Penn places lots of students at top law schools (but, unsurprisingly, fewer than Harvard, Yale etc. undergrad, because those schools have even higher concentrations of high LSAT/GPA performers).\nIf you want to go to a great law school, concentrate on getting a great GPA and LSAT score. If you have a full ride to UIUC, it means you've got what it takes to get a great GPA (and probably great LSAT) there too.\nIt's much better to be in a great law school with a UIUC degree and no debt, in comparison to being in the very same law school with a UPenn degree and $150K+ in undergrad debt. Law school debt is bad enough - don't add to it with lots of undergrad debt.\nRunswimyoga also said that Obama was more credible because he went to Columbia/Harvard Law, as opposed to Occidental. The correct premise there, though, is that Obama had more credibility in his early years because of his Harvard Law degree - that degree opened up elite firms/circles for him in Chicago. If he went to Occidental/Harvard Law it would've been largely the same trend. The key there was his law school, not his undergrad.\nI should close by saying, at the undergrad level, a top school is really only worth a lot of debt if either a.) you can afford the debt or b.) you're SURE you're going into a lucrative major/field (like business). So, for the poster whose child got into Wharton - absolutely, it's a great idea to go. Top schools have an edge in finance/consulting recruiting. For other fields - the debt is rarely worth it. Columbia might have a better pipeline to writers at the NY Times than UIUC, but if you have $200k in debt, you probably can't take that $50k/yr entry job at the times anyway.

Those stats vary quite a bit by year depending on who chooses to go onto grad school straight after undergrad-- which is a little less common for Penn students than their peers.\nAnyway-- that's irrelevant on the whole. Yes, Penn has a higher concentration of better LSAT scores buuuuut they also have an edge in placement. We can use Cornell and Harvard as a case study here because both have data they've made available to the public. (http://www.career.cornell.edu/resources/upload/2013-14-PreLaw-Guide.pdf) (http://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/law_stats.pdf?m=1429122846)\nWe'll take a top law school that neither is not affiliated with either university as an example: Columbia Law School.\nCornell had 120 applicants hoping to enroll in 2012 at Columbia Law. Only 28 were admitted and they had an average LSAT/GPA of 172.2/3.82. So an admissions rate of 23,3% Still better than the overall admit rate for Columbia Law that year.. and yet...\nHarvard had 150 applicants hoping to enroll in 2012 at Columbia Law school. 66 were admitted for an admit rate of 44%. Their mean LSAT/GPA was 172/3.71. A pretty big difference in GPA and a tiny difference in LSAT.\nBut if you think Columbia law is a fluke, you can see that the pattern holds true for other schools as well.\nStanford Law: Cornell: 12% acceptance rate. 172.6/3.88 LSAT/GPA. Harvard: 23% acceptance rate. 171.8/3.78.\nOr let's take Cornell law where one would assume Cornell grads have an advantage:\nCornell Law: Cornell: 36% acceptance rate. 168.3/3.73 LSAT/GPA. Harvard: 35% acceptance rate. 166.7/3.61 LSAT/GPA.\nAnd the list goes on.\nSo on average, the Harvard students were numerically less qualified than their peers at Cornell. And yet they still did remarkably better in the law school admissions game with higher percentages of their students being accepted despite the lower metrics. Now, if you think the difference between two ivies is pronounced, then imagine what the difference between an Ivy and a less 'name brand' institution will be (hint: enormous).\nI am TOTALLY on board with minimizing debt for law school. But... the odds are HEAVILY stacked against you if you don't go to a top law school and they're generally stacked against you in the admissions game if you didn't go to a top undergrad. \"thems the breaks,\" as they say.

This isn't the SATs or the GRE's where a difference of 20 points might not mean all that much. And you're not competing with a bunch of high school kids with only their k-12 lives to speak for. Getting just *one more point* on the LSAT is one of those nearly impossible things to do. A 170 out of 180 puts you in the 99th percentile of LSAT scorers but a 163 drops you all the way down to the 88th percentile of test takers and renders you largely ineligible for acceptance to the best schools barring highly unique 'soft factors' or an extremely high GPA. An advantage of 1 point on the LSAT can be the difference between getting into Harvard law vs not getting into a T-14 school at all. An advantage of .1 in your GPA can be the difference between being a strong applicant for UChicago and being in the bottom 25th percentile of their entering class and rendering your application all but impotent. And thereby, it is the difference between essentially being guaranteed a well paying job that requires a JD versus being at a law school where barely 80% of the JDs are getting jobs that require their law degrees and even fewer are getting them in desirable legal markets. And the majority are probably not jobs that are paying them well enough to pay back the loans they inevitably took out because they didn't have just 'one more point on the LSAT' to get them big scholarship money. 200k is a drop in the bucket when compared to the earning potential and professional flexibility intrinsic to a law degree from a top school. And frankly, 200K for undergrad can save you 300K for law school because again, students are offered scholarship money based on how much they want to recruit you- and they want to recruit people from top schools because it is useful for their branding.\nHarvard doesn't have the same advantage over the other ivies like Penn and Columbia and similar schools like Chicago. While it does exist, the difference in admissions between Harvard and Cornell is more pronounced. Take the student population at Yale law (because the data is publicly available), for example, where you can assume that the majority of admitted students will attend (since their yield is about 83%). It's also pretty safe to assume that disproportionately more Harvard students apply to Yale than those of other ivies (and similar schools) given the data we've already seen comparing Harvard and Cornell, given that Yale isn't even among the top 10 most commonly applied to law schools at Penn (http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/20142015lawstats.php), and the fact that Harvard often has more applicants to law school than Penn and Columbia despite having a smaller class size than both C & P (Harvard UG enrollment: 6694, Columbia: 8613, Penn: 9746). And while that might account for the difference in the number of students from Harvard and Columbia/Penn represented at YLS-- it's pretty exaggerated to account for the difference between Harvard and Cornell: (http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/law.pdf)\nHarvard: 66, Columbia: 29, Penn: 21, UChicago: 14, Duke: 12, Northwestern: 9, Cornell: 8.\nAnd the year before: (http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/archivepdffiles/Law/Law_2014-2015.pdf)\nHarvard: 80, Columbia: 23, Penn: 22, UChicago: 17, Duke: 12, Northwestern: 10, Cornell: 7.\nThe difference between Harvard and Columbia/Penn could easily be a reflection of the disproportionately large applicant pool from Harvard. The difference between Harvard and Cornell is a little bit harder to justify in that way given how much starker it is and the fact that more Cornell kids are applying to law school than those at Columbia and Penn, and likely in similar numbers to former at Yale Law.\nMatriculation Data (as opposed to admissions data which we were discussing in my previous posts) outside of these two years gets a little wonky because there was extreme volatility in the law school admissions process in the 5-7 years prior to these two matriculating classes due to the terrible economy and the terrible PR law schools were getting with regard to their job placement stats. In contrast, these two years saw a relative slow down in that volatility and a closer return to the 'way things had been' with slight upticks in apps from schools like Columbia, Harvard and Penn and corresponding increases in the strength of those apps as the market regulated. Either way, while H's placement power relative to Columbia and Penn is undoubtedly stronger, it diverges much more sharply with that of Cornell. And the patterns continue the more different from Harvard the schools become: https://careercenter.georgetown.edu/graduate-school/law-school/law-school-application/admissions-statistics-georgetown.htmlhttp://staging.web.emory.edu/career/documents/about/outcomes/pre_law_2012.pdf\nUntil you reach schools where even great LSAT scores and GPAs cease to give these obviously qualified applicants a real shot at admission.\nIn any case, a lot of LSAT takers would trade the naming rights to their first born for just one more LSAT point or .1 GPA. And even more unemployed lawyers or lawyers in non-JD required positions, school funded positions, or at firms not paying them enough to support their families and law school loans would DEFINITELY be willing to trade those naming rights for an advantage of 1 point when they were applying to law school.

If you get a point below that, you're still in great shape for Stanford, Columbia, Chicago, etc. one point doesn't make that big a difference, and is not worth 200k.\nThe lowest Top 14 law school's LSAT average is cornell, with around a 166 median.

Though I do still think it's worth it given the hypercompetitive reality of the law school admissions game, the specific doors and salaries that only certain law schools even among the best schools have access to, and the bleak job prospects outside of the very top schools.\nAlso, no, while Penn and Harvard have a similar total number of apps, with Harvard having more total applicants some years and Penn having more others, Harvard should definitely have more students at Yale because again: Harvard applies to Yale law with at least (if not more than) double the apps as Penn. So no, their numbers shouldn't be similar if Yale is the 6th most popular law school to which Harvard students apply and it's not even in the top 10 for Penn students. Harvard matriculated 66 out of 114 applicants to a school to which it's safe to assume that *less* than 70 Penn students are even *applying* in total (based off of Harvard's app numbers at its top 10 schools and the 'comparable' raw total of apps from both schools. Thus if you assume that Yale is the 11th most popular school choice for Penn applicants, which it probably isn't, it is unlikely to have more than Harvard's 11th most popular choice which only has 69 apps).

On the other hand, dorms like Kings Court, Gregory, and Hill are much further away from the quad. Stouffer itself is also mostly freshman, so you will also have the chance to make many friends around your hall.\nIf you want a non-quad double, then applying to Freshman Experience in Harrison can be a good option. You would get to live in an apartment-style suite with a kitchen, private bath, and common room. If you're looking for a non-quad double that isn't in a high rise, then you can choose from Hill, Kings Court, and Stouffer. Out of the three, Stouffer has the most convenient location for a freshman, but there are only a few doubles in Stouffer.\nIf you want a non-quad triple, I'd recommend Mayer Hall. Mayer is probably the nicest dorm on campus, and the rooms are the largest on campus (definitely bigger than the high rises). Even with three people living in one room, you'd all have plenty of space, plus your own common room, bathroom and kitchen. Also, Mayer is organized such that all the freshman live on the 5th and 6th floors, so you won't be isolated from other freshman in any way.\nThere are also some other room types that I haven't mentioned (see page 57 for a full outline of all room possibilities).\nHope this helps. Also consider residential programs in different houses (I mentioned Freshman Experience, but there are many others).\" ", "user_id": "100502373", "user_name": "WhartonPenn2017 ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "205"}, {"date": {"month": "April", "day": "5,", "year": "2016", "time": "12:24PM"}, "comment": "\nGood luck with your choice.

My personal opinion is that scheduling an overnight visit that's NOT during Quaker Days (or whatever they're calling Penn Previews this year) would be a mistake. The applicant's experience and exposure would be limited to the personal orbit of the student with whom he/she happened to stay. During Quaker Days, on the other hand, there will be informative events of more general and specific interest to admitted applicants, in addition to the opportunities to stay and visit with individual students. And Penn will be in session during that time, allowing admitted applicants to get a \"real feel\" for the school.\nJust my 2 cents (if it's worth even that much ;-)).

Before I heard of this website I really thought I had like a 85% chance of getting into an Ivy League. All my college apps were turned in (and many cc threads were read) and by Ivy Day I thought I had a 1% chance of getting into any. Although this is clich\u00e9, you should really try to apply to these schools, you never know what could happen (6 rejections but accepted to the one school that I actually truly wanted to go to). I would have to note though that I worked really hard throughout high school to maintain my GPA and get my subpar (for these schools) test scores, and even harder on the applications just to muster a competitive one. Lastly, don't be upset if you get rejected from most or all your top choices; it's not the end of the world.

After I was deferred, I continued to write letters to Penn, send them updates about my accomplishments, and hold hope that I'd be accepted. I think this continued interest definitely paid off and is a big reason why I've been admitted. So future Penn applicants out there, don't lose hope!

You will have equally good chances of breaking into investment banking regardless of what you study at Penn.

You have three outstanding options available to you. I don't have much experience with Penn's computer science program though I know for a fact that Penn CS majors go onto do great things. You should check out the career services senior surveys (http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/files/2015_Senior_Survey_Final.pdf).\nAs you can see, Penngineering CS majors have an average starting salary of $97,698 which is comparable to Cornell's 92,731 (http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/career_services/students/statistics/upload/2014-Computer-Science.pdf). Additionally, Penn CS and Cornell CS majors seem to work for the same companies (amazon, google, goldman, facebook, etc. etc.). In terms of grad schools, Penn CS majors went to Penn, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Cornell CS majors went on to Cornell, Stanford, and Berkeley.\nSo outcomes appear to be pretty similar. You will probably be best served by comparing several years of data available here (http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/career_services/students/statistics/postgrad_reports.cfm) and here (http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/reports.php).\nBeyond that, Philly is a great place to go to school. As you've rightly noted, there are tons of internship opportunities available to you and many think tanks and research hubs both on and off Penn's campus at which you can really sink your teeth into some incredible scholarly opportunities. Penn, along with the other Philly universities, are really creating something of a tech hub in Philly and the new Pennovation Center will go a long way in bringing Philly even closer to that goal (http://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/). In contrast, Cornell is building their new 'tech hub' in NYC (http://tech.cornell.edu/). In addition, the Philadelphia city government will provide numerous opportunities to apply what you learn in the class room to public policy questions facing the city that intersect with computer science as a discipline. And being right on the Northeast Corridor will give you easy access to NYC and DC for even more opportunities.\nFinally, I don't know how much of an influence Wharton has over the CS department but I can assure you that in general, your experience at Penn will not be dominated by Wharton's influence. While from the outside it can definitely seem like Wharton is an attention stealer, it is genuinely and seamlessly integrated with the University in a way that only benefits students. If you don't want the entrepreneurial side of Penn to influence your CS education, it will not be hard to avoid it. Penn is really a 'choose your own adventure' when it comes to taking advantage of or avoiding the vast resources it has to offer.\nI hope this is somewhat helpful. If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask. I can tell you that I chose Penn (the College, not engineering) because of its outstanding academics, beautiful urban campus in the heart of America's fifth largest city, exciting social life, supportive yet intense atmosphere, and unparalleled interdisciplinary opportunities.

Also the smaller size of the department specifically and the entire undergraduate school in general, is probably a plus for Penn. Cornell has obviously the stronger engineering department and reputation. So it is a trade off. For undergrad just the strength of the specific department is not the only important factor to consider, especially since Penn has also a strong CS program. You can't go wrong with either really comes down to weighing what is most important to you and also considering fit since Penn and Cornell are very different in terms of location and social life. Penn has a very vibrant social life (it is the social ivy after all) , is in a major city. Cornell is the opposite from that. Also grade deflation is bigger at Cornell than Penn. At Pen you can also submatrculate and get a masters degree in 4-5 years total.\nNow when it comes to vanderbilt, it depends on how important the cost factor is for your family budget.

I was able to contact current students both in CS and in M&T and they resoundingly confirmed your points in that although Wharton does have a strong presence on campus and is a valuable resource, it does not take away from any of the aspects of other majors in a significant way. I would also have to agree Philly is a great hub for internships/research which is a great plus. Cornell has similarly great on-campus research, but summer internships may be slightly less accessible.@Penn95 Great point in saying that Penn has more interdisciplinary access. This is particularly useful in the case that I want to pursue any sort of dual degree which may not be possible at Cornell. In particular I was unaware about the sub-matriculation policies at Penn and upon a closer look found another potential plus at Penn. On the other hand there is the apparent trade-off that although Cornell has a slight edge on its engineering program, Penn's city life and social lifestyle may be worth it -- this will be something I look more closely into when I revisit these schools.\nAs of right now I'm leaning towards Penn slightly, but I'd love to hear more thoughts.

Also it is very unlikely that wharton admit rate is at harvard/yale level i.e 5-6%. It is much more probable that wharton admit rate is around 7-8%. I have done a very rough analysis based on bits of info here and there and it is more reasonable for wharton admit rate to be in that range. The dual degree programs, huntsman, m&t, lsm prob have admit rates at the level of stanford, harvard and also yields at these levels. Also wharton probably has yield rate higher than yale and princeton but lower than harvard and stanford ( i would bet around 75%). Also i think the there is not really a distinction between wharton and non wharton students in terms of wharton students being more accomplished or anything as a group. I think there is however a substantial difference between students ( as a total group) who are m&t, lsm, the other vagelos programs ( and to a lesser degree huntsman) and the rest of penn students as a group.

Initially, the courses were easy because they are trying to bring everyone up to speed. She was bored. As time went by courses picked up the pace and her faculty advisor switched her into more difficult classes to challenge her.\nShe works hard, but is also very sociable. She is in a sorority and that has been a big plus.

Out of her 2 years there there were about 4 or 5 weeks where she really felt overwhelmed and out of control. She buckled down and in the end her grades were still excellent, but she is still mad about it. lol On the other hand, if that never happened, I think she would feel cheated.\nI think that you will find that Case can be very challenging too, but toned down a notch compared to Penn.

These are three amazing schools. And i am in a particularly good position, i think, to share a little bit of insight into making a decision between the three as these were my top three choices after having been accepted back in the day!\nI will answer your questions but let me begin by saying that I chose Penn because I felt it had the best balance between a rigorous, ivy league education, an incredible urban campus in the heart of one of America's greatest cities, a social atmosphere that was intense but more collaborative than competitive, and a flexible curriculum that allowed for exploration not only outside of my own major, but outside of the College altogether with opportunities to study in the Law School, Wharton, the Institute of Government, and more. If you have any questions about this, please feel free to ask.\n1. At the undergrad level they are all extremely prestigious. I will say that Yale has better name recognition than Penn and Columbia among laypeople. And Columbia has a little bit more name recognition than Penn. That being said, Penn has a TON of name recognition and the days of people confusing Penn with Penn State are largely all gone. As for employers and grad schools, they are genuinely considered equals. In political science, Yale and Columbia are better known- but again the difference at the undergraduate level will be negligible. Penn's top notch med school brings a lot of attention to the sciences in general at Penn and so i would say for general prestige, the three would be equal for bio. Though all three are about as prestigious as it gets.\n2. The dorm options at the three are pretty different. Yale has a residential college system which a lot of students love. I felt it was kind of limiting. I will say that Yale's residential colleges are mostly all beautiful (check out morse and stiles though if you want some evidence that not every one of Yale's dorms is gorgeous..) and they really create the quintessential 'ivy league' experience. They have intramural sports teams associated with the dorms and formal events as well. They have dining halls in most (or maybe all?) of them. It's definitely a great experience if that's what you're looking for. I wanted more control over where i lived, how i lived, and with whom i lived. Columbia has pretty traditional dorms and most people live on campus because braving the NYC housing market is nearly impossible. Penn, on the other hand, has a College House system that allows students to be placed in different communities depending on their living style preferences. Some are suite style dorms like you would find at Yale in Penn's beautiful Quad. Others, like Rodin, Harnwell, and Harrison, are apartment style high rises. Hill College house is being renovated but it has double-rooms that are organized into community 'pods.' And they are nearing the close of construction on Penn's \"New College House\" (https://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-build-its-first-ever-new-college-house). All of these options, and the many other College Houses at Penn really provide for a unique living experience as your dorm life will differ widely from those of your peers in other College Houses. Students also choose to live off campus (really only within 1 or 2 blocks of campus) in beautiful Victorian era mansions that have been converted into apartments for student living. Penn owns a lot of the land around campus and Penn Police patrol far into west philly as well, giving you the sense that you're still on campus. That being said, you have greater freedom off campus to live in facilities more specifically attuned to your needs. Perhaps you want a big kitchen for your own private use or you would prefer a larger common space to do yoga. Maybe you want a roofdeck or a backyard patio-- those are all options within a block of Penn's campus. I loved the sense of independence I had as someone living off campus at Penn. And I much preferred it to the cramped living quarters at Columbia. Columbia's housing is also integrated with the area around Columbia's campus but because it's new york city, I felt that you lose that sense of campus as you approach dorms that are even a few blocks away. In contrast, because it's only students living around the campus at Penn, you still have the sensation that you're on campus even when you are technically living in your own apartment either alone or with friends. And your financial aid does follow you off campus so you'll be covered if you choose not to live in the College Houses after freshman year.\n3. Penn's social life is the absolute best. Penn's nickname is the \"Social Ivy\" and it genuinely lives up to the hype. At Penn, students take their studies just as seriously as they take their social commitments. What i loved about Penn, however, was that being \"social\" didn't have to mean always partying. It's true that Penn's fraternities and sororities host parties and charity events that are open to all students and that are tons of fun and very stereotypically \"college.\" But students outside of greek life also know how to have a really great time. And because the heart of philly is literally within walking distance of Penn's campus, you can easily take advantage of all that America's fifth largest city has to offer if you want to get away from school for a bit. Penn has the perfect balance of campus life and city fun without either ever detracting from what the other has to offer. There is so much art, culture and food just beyond Penn's gates and so many different student groups, speaker events, and things to do right on campus that the hardest part about being at Penn is choosing which to do first. Philly is the perfect size in which to go to college and Penn's campus and robust campus life do an amazing job of keeping the balance between students looking to go out in the city and those looking to hang around on a friday or saturday. At Columbia, I felt like the campus was too small and cramped and it led a lot of students to socialize away from heart of the school. It also felt like Columbia lacked traditional school spirit. The administration at Columbia is also extremely intense with its students. They give them a hard time when they try to plan events like their spring concert, Bacchanal, and make it impossible to congregate in large groups because of the very limited venues in which they can host on campus events. Additionally, because they have so little green space, the lawns at Columbia are often covered in tarp and inaccessible to the students. But NYC makes for a really good time for Columbia students in a way that their on campus life does not. I also felt as though there was a culture of competitive complaining at Columbia that is hard to explain until you spend some time there. It kind of exists everywhere but I found it to be the most glaring at Columbia. In contrast, Yale has an extremely robust on campus life but New Haven is lacking. It is significantly smaller than either NYC or Philly and it lacks a lot of the opportunities and charm that exist in those larger cities. Most Yalies, however, very happily enjoy their time on campus. In terms of balance however, Penn has the best mix of campus-city life, in my opinion.

Penn is EXTREMELY undergraduate focused. Yale and Penn have a nearly equal number of undergraduate and graduate students while Columbia undergrads are greatly outnumbered by graduate students. And undergraduates at Penn occupy both the physical and metaphorical center of campus life. The One University Policy also allows undergrads to take classes in the other undergraduate schools as well as the graduate and professional schools on campus. This means that professors, even those employed by the graduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences and the Law School know that they might be teaching undergrads at some point. It has also encouraged professors throughout the university to incorporate undergraduates into their research efforts. All three schools have a 6:1 student to faculty ratio and they each spend about the same amount per undergraduate pupil on things like financial aid and student activities. At Columbia, however, I did feel like there were times at which undergraduates took a back seat to graduate students. For example, Columbia undergrads can't access the internet in the Law School Library and it continues to be a small point of contention. It's little slights like not making a library completely accessible that can make the undergrads at Columbia feel a little less loved by the university than their grad school peers. Columbia's famed core is also extremely interesting as an idea but in practice some students find it wanting. For example, the University has trouble attracting the best faculty members to teach sections of the Core and consequently your friend might have Judith Butler as an instructor for their core section and you might have a graduate student who is writing about one of the books on the syllabus for their dissertation as your instructor. All that being said, all three will provide you with a highly undergraduate focused education that will serve you well.\n5. I didn't like the food but I think philly and the foodtrucks that pepper Penn's campus MORE than make up for it. And like c'mon, cheesesteaks are an actual gift from the heavens above. Although, apparently some people love the food at penn: http://www.collegerank.net/best-college-dining-halls/ So take that for what you will...\nIn general, i want to emphasize that you cannot go wrong in choosing between these three. I chose Penn over Yale and Columbia (as well as a few other ivies) because I believed it was the absolute best fit for me. You need to be happy for four years and you need to position yourself well for the future. The best thing you can do is decide what matters most to you as a student and find the school that has those qualities.

That means that the athletic facilities are much better. For example, Columbia's swimming pool is small and literally underground, and Columbia's football field is not on the main campus at all.

I've been wracking my head about this for weeks, and although I've browsed through other discussions (the one at arstechnica has a lot of good info btw for anyone else in my situation), I'd like to ask some questions myself. Good advice would be greatly appreciated!\nI got into Cornell, UPenn, and Northeastern (Honors Program). These are my top three schools! For years, my #1 has been Cornell, but as we're reviewing the different offers and pros and cons of each school (and the thrill of actually getting into some schools has died down), I'm not sure how realistic my dream of going to Cornell may be.\nI want to pursue Materials Science and Engineering or go into Bio/Biomolecular Engineering. From what I've gathered, Cornell is well recognized for its Engineering programs (and hard sciences) and UPenn has been greatly investing in its MatSE department (the new Nanotech building was gorgeous!). On the other hand, Northeastern does not offer MatSE as a major - only a minor. I wouldn't be too hesitant about NEU if I was also solid about bioengineering (which they offer - but \"biomedical\"), but that field is relatively new, and many have said that a degree in this major is not as useful as one in other areas of Engineering because bioengineering is too much of \"a little bit of everything\" and not sufficiently specialized.\n-Can anyone attest to the strength of NEU and UPenn in engineering? Are the differences between their programs and Cornell's that significant or are the US News rankings totally blown out of proportion? I don't want to attend a school that doesn't offer me a good program for the field I'm pursuing.\n-Do all three schools offer strong general science programs that I could switch into if I later feel that engineering isn't for me? (Do they also all allow switching between the College of Eng. and the College of A&S? I know ivies do, but NEU???)\n-Can any Northeastern students interested in MatSE testify to the value of a minor at NEU?\n-Any other thoughts on Bioengineering? Specifically from those who graduated already?\nFrom a financial standpoint, I could go to NEU without paying any tuition, whereas Upenn and Cornell haven't offered me anything. My parents and I are comfortable with them paying half of an ivy education (money already saved for my schooling), and me making up the rest by taking out loans. But I'm trying to figure out if the years in debt are worth it, especially with such a valuable offer from NEU. I'm also considering the funds earned from Co-op (NEU / Cornell) and the starting salary of engineers in my field.\nAs far as location goes, I'm around the Philly area and my family and I feel that staying close has many benefits (so Penn leads there). NEU is located in Boston around some of the biggest companies (that'd be great employers for graduating engineers and students on co-op), whereas Cornell is very much isolated. Both NEU and Cornell are far from where I live, but we feel that NEU is definitely more accessible, while Cornell requires a bus-transfer from a train and I probably would have more trouble getting around the area (esp without a car).\n-Can any Cornell students (I know this is the UPenn Forum) share experiences with transportation? (I saw a thread months ago, but I can't seem to find it now). I understand there's lots of stuff to do within the campus, but does anyone find the isolation stifling?\nMy hesitation with Penn is that it has no co-op whatsoever (I've actually heard a lot of STEM students end up transferring to Drexel, which has a very strong co-op program?). It'd be even harder to pay down student loans and land a job without the great experience and connections that well-integrated co-op programs offer. Then again, I've also heard that \"brand-name\" recognition offers some perks in landing jobs and that smart students should have no problem getting employed even w/o co-op.\nI also understand that Cornell's Co-op program is shorter in duration and less emphasized than NEU's, however I still feel that Cornell's superior program will make up for at least this difference and that any co-op experience is better than none.\nCan I get some thoughts on these worries? I wish I could combine the best of all schools together.

Penn engineering is very strong. If Penn can't offer a good program, they will not offer it.\n2. Penn does not spend as much on engineering research and engineering rankings tend to be based largely on research. In my opinion the differences are greatly exaggerated.\n3. Cornell has terrific engineering too.\n4. Penn may not have coop programs, but the students don't seem to have difficulty finding opportunities. As a freshman, DD1 spent the summer as a research assistant on campus. As a sophomore she has accepted a paid summer internship with Cisco, and was offered two or three others. Most of her friends have paid summer jobs too. There is strong demand for these students.\n5. I think you will find that NEU has a rigorous program, but it is a bit easier than Cornell and Penn.\n6. I am not convinced that the coop program is worth it for students in majors that are in-demand, like engineering. Why not get experience via summer internships, and get your undergrad done a year sooner? I think it is more of a benefit for harder to place majors.\n7. Cornell engineering is more structured than Penn SEAS so you will probably have less flexibility in scheduling. DD has been able to add 2 minors to her CS major at Penn, that would be more difficult at Cornell. Especially since her major and two minors are in three different schools: SEAS, CAS, and Wharton.\n8. The locations are very different between Cornell and Penn.

I never ran for any school office, I preferred to lead in the background (like with founding the tutoring club and being in charge of backstage at concerts) but apparently that doesn't work, essays were probably not as creative as others'\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Wharton is the only Ivy League business school so anyone looking to study business at an Ivy League would apply there.

I wasn't expecting that. But it's not the end of the world. I still have regular decision and I know that wherever I end up, I'll be successful.  But the one thing you shouldn't do is think that just because you have a 2250+ SAT and top grades means a guaranteed spot at an Ivy League.

Everyone got too scared and backed out because it turns out our curriculum was a bit behind IB standards. At my school, IB sciences last two years (both standard level and higher level) but physics was only offered for one year. As a result I essentially self studied half of the course, and the score was pretty good.

I did pop in to request the rec and popped in again to say thanks, but he has too many students to worry about (8 out of 10)\nAdditional Rec: Did not use\nInterview: It was a little awkward, probably does not reflect amazingly or poorly on myself. We didn't talk about penn as much as he gave me career and course advice in general. Then he said the college admissions process was essentially child abuse because of how much stress it puts on students, and he also emphasized that no matter where I go, I would have a great future.

I changed the location literally last minute (I didn't pay attention to when the location would close..) which may have left a wishy washy first impression. But I asserted myself as it went on.

I know my hard work has paid off. To be honest however, I am still a bit bummed about not getting into the Dual Degree but oh well. I know my profile fits \"College of Arts and Sciences\" much better but I wanted to give LSM a run for its money. I thought my LSM essay was amazing but in the end I guess I didn't fit and my SAT CR was not good. Still thrilled to have gotten into Penn CAS though and don't have to worry about the college search anymore!\nHere's my two cents:\n1) You don't need to have a laundry list of clubs. I barely participated in clubs at school and the ones I put down other than DECA are literally no time commitment or significant. If you have something that shows you are involved, like three sport athlete and school orchestra, then you are fine! Don't be intimidated by people putting \"president\" for like 10+ other BS clubs.\n2) Let your passions speak for itself. Also don't think something is too \"common\". You think violin is common for asian males? Yes. But did it prevent me from writing a unique essay and showing my real passion for music in my app? Nope!. If you think that admissions officers will lightly look at something, elaborate on it on the additional writing section or your essays! Don't give incomplete info!\n3) My supplements helped me a lot. My Oil Painting portfolio dispelled any myths whether i was legit at art or not. If you send in supplements however, make sure they are actually quality.\n4) SAT Score isn't everything - probably heard this before, but its true. TRANSCRIPT > SAT.\n5) Keep revising your essays over and over again. And ask for help!\nStrengths (part of reflection too): >> Extracurricular TIME COMMITMENT (almost every one i did all four years of high school) and Quality (national recognition for violin, national rank for soccer, oil painting awards). School feeds to Penn. Also the Summer Lab at Penn + Lab Rec. >> Supplements - I even deleted a so-so violin recording last second to make sure my supplements were very high quality. I think my Oil Painting portfolio I submitted really showed that I'm not just a random person who took art class at school. I only sent in 1 work that I did at school, the 9 others were from outside of school I did at private studio which were Extremely High Quality.\nWeaknesses: SAT Critical Reading (Literally defeated me after 2 years of battling it), [*For LSM] - not enough Science EC's - only did 1 year of lab research, Bad Start on the interview, only 25 spots anyways lol\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: explained above\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: --\nPitt screwed up my rolling decision app - so I might get a rejection letter from them saying my application was incomplete Haha!!.

Can't give you an objective rating because I honestly can't tell.\nRecommendations (rating 1-10, details):\nTeacher Rec #1:AP Chem teacher 8/10 (My fav teacher, she really helped me enjoy science, only kid ever to make USNCO finalist under her, but she didn't always say I was one of her \"best students ever\")\nTeacher Rec #2:APUSH teacher: 5/10 I read it and it was kinda all filler. I might ask him to re-write.\nCounselor Rec: 10/10 She said it was amazing but I haven't seen it. I really hope it was.\nAdditional Rec:\nInterview: Lasted for an hour. Kinda let him talk since he wouldn't shut up about his son. Nice guy, but kinda hard to talk to: never really knew when to start/stop speaking. Wasn't bad but wasn't my strongest interview.\nOther\nApplied for Financial Aid?: Yes\nIntended Major: Finance + Statistics\nState (if domestic applicant): WI\nCountry (if international applicant): USA\nSchool Type: Small Public ~950 kids total\nEthnicity: Indian\nGender: M\nIncome Bracket: Used to be around $130k, currently is 25k since my dad left his job\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None :'''''''''(\nReflection: So my scores were fine, I think the main problem areas are essays, recommendations and leadership. It's hard to get leadership stuff in my school because we don't elect officers, so I think that hurt me. Also Penn had literally never before heard of my school so that was a minus. I'm not a great writer, and my common app could've gone the wrong way so that could be another factor. Also, I didn't really know much about Penn, I only looked into it starting in October and that was a mistake since ED really needs to show advanced interest. Lastly I should've asked for more recommendations because I only asked two teachers and that wasn't great planning.\nStrengths: Scores, Did well in hard classes\nWeaknesses: Essays, Recs, and Leadership in ECs\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Above^^^^^^^^^^^\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected:\nGeneral Comments : Read through my reflection if you're an underclassmen and if you're applying this year best of luck to you!\nTO ALL UNDERCLASSMEN: Make sure you have good ECs.

I LOVED the class a lot, put a lot of effort into everything I did, and did pretty well academically. But, I feel like my teacher was rushed writing a ton of recs for kids for the early admissions round in addition to his school duties (social studies department chair, picking up new subject to teach, etc.) so it probably wasn't as good as it could've been.\nTeacher Rec #2: Bio teacher - 9/10. I had her for four weeks of AP Biology this semester before she got promoted and left my high school lol. But, the whole year before, she was our HOSA sponsor and through our HOSA struggles, we grew pretty close.\nCounselor Rec: 5-6/10. She has 400 others kids to worry about, and I don't know her that well, so probably generic.\nAdditional Rec: N/A\nInterview: My interview was with a Class of 2015 alum and it was over the phone because I guess there wasn't enough interviewers in my region apparently? It lasted around 30 minutes and it wasn't bad.

I was a mess when I found out and I'm still a little mentally unstable, but this was the best best best thing that could've happened to me before finals week/December college app hell, so thank you Penn  I think I got a little lucky because I'm more of a \"well-rounder\" than someone with intense passions. I wish I started my essays a little ahead of time but I'm happy with the way they turned out.\nStrengths: My scores were really good and I think the effort I put into my essays showed. Also, skating is kinda unique, I guess.\nWeaknesses: Recommendations, too many extracurriculars??? (being \"well-rounded\" vs. having focus)\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Good academics, diligence + apparent effort\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Penn has been my second decision so far! Accepted UGA EA (in state). I already applied to Georgia Tech, UChicago (my other top choice, equal to Penn), Stanford, and WashU, but nothing back yet.\nGeneral Comments : Good luck to everyone for the next round of college decisions!

Yes, I worked hard, but I wasn't some ISEF finalist, and I loved writing, but I only submitted to my first big contest in my junior year. And yet, I somehow got recruited for writing, and eventually got in. It doesn't feel real at all, but I guess that's how life is. Weird stuff happens all the time, and I suppose what applying to college has shown me is that there is no script, there should be no preconceptions about what is going to happen, because admissions might just see something in us that makes them believe. I'm so honored to have gotten into Penn, that those reading my writing and my application decided to give me a shot; I'm still in shock now, so I know I'm not expressing how I'm feeling in the best way possible, but I'm so thankful for this opportunity and I swear I won't waste it.

I did tons of research and talked about specific professors, clubs, and activities that I would want to partake in.\nLSM Supplement: 8/10; I discussed one of my research projects and how my team and I came up with a novel research advancement but did not have the information and tools to have a mass market application. I discussed and gave specific, personal examples on how a business education from Wharton would allow me to take my passion for scientific research to the next level.

I love this teacher, and I've spent so much time with him because of FIRST robotics throughout high school. I have put a lot of effort into this class, and I'm really passionate about the robotics team that this teacher is a coach for. Overall, we have always gotten along really well, and he said that this was the best rec he has ever written.\nTeacher Rec # 2: World History Teacher 8-9/10. This was one of my favorite classes in high school, and this teacher is one of my favorites as well. I did really well in World History, and I was very passionate when it came to group discussions, projects, and other aspects of the class. This teacher asked me if he could write my recommendation.\nCounselor Rec: 9/10 The college counselors at my high school are phenomenal, and I've grown really close with my counselor over the last two years. She's super easy to talk to and spends hours upon hours of time on each recommendation she writes. Honestly, this entire process would have been so much harder without her help.\nAdditional Rec: N/A Sometimes, additional recommendations take away from the ones already there. I didn't think an additional recommendation would have been helpful in my situation.\nInterview: 8/10 The interview was around 30 mins over the phone with a recent LSM graduate. The questions were fairly straightforward, but we really connected during the interview. She was super friendly, and I covered everything I hoped for during the interview. She seemed to appreciate my responses, and she answered my questions about LSM as well!\nOther\nApplied for Financial Aid?: No\nIntended Major: LSM so dual degree (Biology for CAS, Undecided concentration Wharton)\nState (if domestic applicant): OH\nCountry (if international applicant): USA\nSchool Type: Private\nEthnicity: South Asian (Indian)\nGender: Male\nIncome Bracket: >$200k\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None\nReflection: I am in complete shock that I was accepted into LSM.

I honestly thought that I had absolutely no chance at LSM, and I was completely shocked today when I saw the acceptance.

It was extremely late in the game (I was contacted like November 28) so I was expecting to not get an interview, and I was on vacation when I got the email for a skype interview so I didn't get as much opportunity to plan as I would've liked. Still, the interviewer was super relaxed, and he's only 5 years older than I am so the advice he gave was really relevant.

Lol no, seriously, I was expecting total rejection so even to know I was being somewhat considered is the biggest honor. I've gotten extremely attached to Penn in the last few months, and I'm not going to let go now. Even still, hopefully I'll get in somewhere else I apply. My world isn't going to end because of this. (though I wish I could say my obsession over Penn would end....deferrals are such teases)\nWeaknesses: SAT SUBJECT TESTS. Man, those sucked. I might retake in January since Penn lets RD applicants send Jan scores. My recs probably weren't as stellar as required for a school of Penn's caliber, but that could just be my own self-pity talking. Essays could have been better. The usual things\nWhy you think you were deferred: I don't know, haha. I hoped that my ACT score would help me, so maybe that's what's even keeping me in the running. I know Alabama isn't super well represented, so I was sort of banking on the chance that maybe I'd be the only Alabama applicant and they'd have to accept me because of statistics. Oh, and my grades sucked freshman year.They probably just want to read over my application again because it was so good they can't let go of it even to accept me.

Also my subject test scores weren't good either but only had half a semester of AP Physics before the AP, Math lv 2 was a bit disappointing though. To be honest no one in my entire school has done well with SATs. The highest score from my school is a 2020 and there are lots of us who have GPAs of 3.9 and above.\nWould love feedback if anyone is willing. Gonna be trying my luck at duke, NYU, dartmouth, Princeton and cornel as well. Mainly because they give need-based financial aid to International students and that's the only way I'll be able to afford a US education. Please don't say improve SAT, because it just won't happen. Any other suggestions would be great! \nCongrats to everyone who got in!

Went on Spain immersion trip for 2 weeks -- lived with a family in Spain.\nEssays (rating 1-10, details):\nCommon App (9): I wrote about my love to create things and make use of things and create them anew. I personally called it the Jazz essay because I wrote first about my love for music production and how I was able to sample an old Jazz song and turn it into a modern rap beat. (Yes I have a soundcloud). But then I took those same principles and applied them to many other things -- like redesigning my schools literary magazine -- and like my senior project which is producing music with other students from my school. My unstated thesis was that I love creative innovation, and that I am at heart a creative innovator.\nWhy Penn (10): I wrote about the Urban Studies major Im applying for and why I liked it so much. At first I thought it would be like a random major I could apply for so I could get in off of it, however, I realized that its super cool and unique in its own way so I was able to write about many of the cool things the program offers. Its bascially studying the sociology of a city and what makes it function -- which is something most people dont think of. I was able to apply what I learned from my real estate internship with what I could potentially learn about urban settings. I also threw in my love for music and how music can effect a city -- but most importantly, I painted a picture in the intro and outro of what I would look like being a student at Penn etc etc, blah blah blah.\nRecommendations (rating 1-10, details):\nTeacher Rec #1: (10) My history teacher is the MAN, and he went to Penn so he definitely helped me out a little there, even if he didnt explicitly mention Penn in his essay, he made me look really good.\nTeacher Rec #2: (8) My calc/stat teacher for junior year. Definitely saw me as a strong math student and saw that I was often a head of the game in his classes, (AB calc was too easy, but now BC calc is too hard haha).\nCounselor Rec: (11, if it was possible) My councilor is also my homeroom teacher and I know hes one of my biggest supporters. Being class president and all, Ive worked with him through a lot of different things throughout the school and hes seen me not only as a strong academic student, but also as a general leader.\nAdditional Rec: N/A\nInterview: 10/10, I ended up just talking about life with my interviewer. His son went to Penn so we just talked a lot about his son and such.

If I were to give any advice on the essays it would be this (but do I have the place to give advice?? idk like how did I get in???): be as specific as possible and personal and as real as possible. don't try to over-dramatize things...unless your personality is melodramatic in the first place..then preserve some of that..i'm (apparently) melodramatic, esp. in my first drafts??? epic fail. but let a lot of people read it. not necessarily peers and parents, but find some really smart ppl that you respect intellectually, you know!! harass everyone!! I got this graduate student who went undergrad at Yale and is now in CA and this former admissions lady at CMU. My first draft was completely different from my last because if I learned anything from them, it's to be super specific. Also, I started my 650 word common app at 1200 words if that's any indication of how much I fit into the essay.\nAlso, I guess I had a bunch of smaller awards that I didn't list. Like those grade ones (like best math student, science student!!, etc. not that those matter at all) but also like top AMC score in school, and best soloist awards at local orchestra or solo competitions. And also like 3rd in southeaster pa for debate and i've played with some super famous musicians?? like stuff that isn't huge like Intel but I had a lot of that crap so I guess it added up.\nAnd now I'm REALLY rambling..(sorry!!..just not tryna do my homework) but for my service trip, I didn't talk about it outside of \"additional comments\" and instead of taking the traditional, \"I learned so much I am so much more appreciative\" which is great and true but overdone, I explained how it connected to my passion in global and public health and what I learned and saw.\nI guess nice teachers and ECs help too. actually, ECs really help!! And although it may look like I had a bunch of junk on there I added just bc, I made it clear I did all those things bc I really love all (jk..most) of them.\nStrengths: essays, ECs\nWeaknesses: not that many major awards. didn't cure cancer. not founder of billion dollar startup. is not president of world.\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: in addition to all the crap i just wrote, I guess it was pretty evident, esp. in interview, that I have strong opinions and I love learning about the world (?? if that makes sense). but I guess it was a plus that I have actual interests and passions in current events and life in general...and I know people say \"dont be political!!!\" but I wasn't really...I think the key is to not be too ostentatious or at all offensive. just present like, oh I have ideas and opinions, and I care about the world. there are things I want to change and this is how bc I am a legitimate human being and not a robot that tests well\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: before this, I only heard back from psu main (acceptance) and three schools in the UK which I got accepted to --- Imperial College London, Edinburgh, and Durham\nGeneral Comments : i think i did that already. best of luck to any RD applicants or those applying in later years!! i hope all of your life dreams come true.

In 10th grade, I was not sure if going abroad is a proper option. Thus, I stayed in the Chinese Gaokao track for a year and entered the \"Competition Class\", where students dedicate themselves to math, physics or chemistry competitions, both national and international. In retrospect, it was the experience in the competition class that fostered my strong science background.\nSecond, my activities have a clear focus since I have a clear future plan, yet I displayed a wide interest in areas including literature, music and more. . Combining biological experiments with business ventures and my passion for the environment, I knew I was fit for the M&T program that I applied.\nThird, participating in Penn M&TSI and interning for a Wharton graduate certainly helps--not in a sense that they could somewhat give you an edge in the application, but in that you can know Penn from a much more personal and tangible level.\nWeaknesses:\nFirst, I filled just hours before the deadline. This procrastination is not something beneficial in business.\nSecond, I'm an Asian middle class male applying from China with a Chinese citizenship. 'Nuff said.\nThird, limited major awards that are recognized in the states.\nFourth, SAT Reasoning score not outstanding enough.\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Honestly, I tried my best and could not have done anything better.\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted ED, withdrawn all other applications.\nGeneral Comments:\nOne thing I pride myself upon is my ability to assess myself. I was able to subjectively evaluate my strength and weaknesses and make corrections. I was able to set my goals appropriately so that by some reasonable stretch and effort I could attain that goal. Such ability is the true reason why I am accepted.\nYet that ability comes at a huge cost. From nine or ten my life was filled with goals and the process of achieving goals. Step by step, I came from a poor little county from Hubei province to a community primary school in Beijing to the very best high school in Beijing/China and to this world-renowned institution. Between each and every one of these transitions are endless hours studying, reciting, practicing, and competing. Never did I have time to appreciate other possibilities, to let things work themselves out.\nNow as I got into M&T, a clear career lay before me. I could see myself, in five years, sitting in front of the desk in some financial institution, burying down my head. I planned that future, a possibly successful one, and I know I'd probably achieve. I mastermind my entire life fastidiously; yet is that what life's supposed to be? What have I missed, as I have been blinded by the glory of endlessly achieving goals?\nCollege is defined by the numerous options it provides, and UPenn is no exception. Committing myself to M&T means a whole lot of opportunities eliminated, due to various constraints. Will it lay foundations for my later planned career, or will it open an entirely new door for me? Who knowns. And who knows which outcome would be more preferable!\nYet more puzzlingly, is my planned and structured life another form of just getting along, this time with the popular opinion of success? Am I actually just controlling my life by name and letting it slide with the public opinion in essence? I do not know.\nI may or may not be able to control my life; I cannot possibly tell whether it is better to control my life or not to; and I cannot even tell if what now appears to be me controlling my fate is actually me controlling my fate. Yet life just goes on. It occurred to me that almost no one is living his or her life entirely sober. Sometimes we just have to go along and settle with that confusion and dizziness, and move along.\nEnough of my nonsense. Wish you have a fantastic admission result, and a fantastic life.

What a wonderful position to be in -- choosing between two ivies and one of the seven sisters! That's truly outstanding.\nAs has been stated, your experience at the three schools would probably be incredibly different though I'm sure that the quality of the education you receive will be pretty similar.\nWellesley is obviously open only to Women so that will probably dramatically shift your experience quite a bit. Brown and Penn will be more similar to one another since they're both co-ed ivies with the resources of a top notch research university supporting the undergraduate experience. At Penn you'll be in a quintessential liberal arts college at the heart of one of the most outstanding research universities in the world. Thanks to the One University Policy you will also be able to take some Comp Sci classes at Penn even if you aren't in the engineering school. Alternatively, you can also do a double major between The College and Engineering without actually having to be enrolled in both schools so your interest in comp sci does not have to take a back seat to your passion for the liberal arts. PPE is an incredible major that can provide you with a very different academic experience depending on how you choose to pursue the major. Some students decide on a very general exploration of the three subjects without diving too deeply into any particular one; Others choose to focus very heavily on either Politics, Philosophy, or Econ while using the breadth of courses available to inform their academic experience in the one subject. In general, it's an outstanding opportunity to take advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of a Penn education. It is also a major that will allow you to cross traditional school boundaries as well. Thanks again to the One University Policy, you can add classes from the Law School, the graduate school, the Business & Public Policy department in Wharton, or any of the other wonderful departments across Penn's other undergraduate, graduate and professional schools to your academic exploration. There are so many different ways to approach a Penn education and the entire university is really very accessible. Much more research is done at Penn than at either Brown or Wellesley so if you are considering becoming involved in undergraduate research, I highly recommend you look into the opportunities available at each school. At Penn, finding a professor doing research with similar interests at the forefront of your field will be easy. There are resources like the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships available to students who want a formalized way of finding a mentor or pre-existing project, while others choose to just ask professors with whom they're comfortable if the professor needs help with what they're working on. I know much less about Modern Middle Eastern Studies but I'm sure it's also a really outstanding department. By nature, that major will also be highly interdisciplinary and many of the same opportunities I've already discussed would benefit you there as well. Penn's flexible curriculum will serve you well as you are encouraged to step outside of your comfort zone but never so restricted that you wouldn't be able to fit in an extra minor or the electives you really want to take but that don't necessarily fit into your major requirements/general education requirements. It is a very well calibrated system for students who are curious and open minded yet who like to be pushed academically.\nBeyond the academic opportunities, Penn's larger size and reputation as the \"Social Ivy\" definitely infuses a certain energy into campus life. People take their academics very seriously but they also take socializing very seriously as well. And being in America's fifth largest city will transform your experience too. You will be a few minutes away from some of the most amazing art collections in the world, some of the best restaurants, and some of the most historic sites in America. Penn has a beautiful, compact, yet spacious 300 acre campus in the heart of Philadelphia. It has enough exciting campus life and enough space to keep students interested in hanging around on weekends and nights but it is close enough to all that Philly has to offer to make it easy to run into center city for a day in Rittenhouse Square or a stroll along the river. Students take full advantage of the shopping, culture, and more throughout the year and yet Philly's manageable size ensures that its presence never detracts from campus life. It is truly, I think, the ideal balance between city and campus.\nCongrats again! You have three wonderful options. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask- i'm happy to answer them!

Although I've been browsing CC for a few months, I recently decided to make an account and this is my first post - excuse me if I unknowingly break a posting rule or have improper etiquette.\nI'm a Canadian high school student (grade 12) who will be attending a top Canadian business university next year. That being said, I intend to apply for a transfer to Wharton for my third year. Now, I know, one doesn't just wake up and say, \"I want to go to Wharton!\" Many plan from the moment they step into high school - I haven't been. After browsing UPenn's transfer page, I couldn't find all the information I wanted. Just had some questions about my situation and the steps to put together a solid application to apply for a transfer (I realize the rates are ~1%). If anyones been in a similar place as I am, please feel free to share any experiences or tips!\nInsight on me:\nI have wrote neither the SAT or ACT, also not an IB student but will be writing AP exams this May. Expecting a 5 on Stat, Micro, Macro, CalAB. No outstanding awards or achievements (honour roll, yes, but that's just minor). No outstanding EC's either - work experience as an accountant for 4 months so far is probably my most notable. Can write solid essays and will be able to get great marks in university, those two things are of no concern to me. Will work on the EC's and get back into athletics during the summer and throughout university. Currently teaching myself Italian and Chinese.\nQuestions:\nI believe I will still have to write the SAT/ACT, and get a high mark to have a slight chance at the most. When I do write the exams, I will be in my first year of university - does that make a difference?\nWhen applying for a transfer, will my high school transcript play a huge role? My grades were not consistently high, but they do go up year after year (with the exception of grade 11, it shows improvement, current average is 94).\nWith high university and SAT/ACT marks, great work experience (about to pick up another assistant job at a bank, but plan to do more), and above average EC's/recommendations, would I stand any chance? Is there something extra, something I'm missing, or something I'm doing wrong? Something I could be doing? Any tips or criticism is welcomed!

Although I know UPenn is a really, really good school (and georgia tech is really good to), it will be costing me 3x more per year than Georgia Tech. With that being said, is UPenn worth it? After college, I plan on either getting my MD or PHD in chemistry. If I go to UPenn, what if I don't have the money left over to afford the extra years of school? BTW at tech I would do the honors program and at UPenn I will do the Vagelors Scholars Program of the Molecular Life Sciences. I really really love both schools. I just feel like if I do not go the Penn, I am missing out on a whole different level of education and prestige that can get me into better medical schools. I also feel like difficulty wise, both schools are about the same, although UPenn has a better social life. I've never made a decision this crucial to my life so I'm kind of scared to leave Georgia, but at the same time I don't want to pass up the opportunity of a life time at UPenn. Oh year and I read online that the average acceptance to medical school from GT is 55% while at UPenn it is 83%... Summary: although I like both schools a lot, I feel like UPenn is better for what I want to do but it is wayyy more expensive. Has anybody else experienced this problem? What did you do? any advice would help! Thanks!

Have you talked to Penn about whether there is anything they can do to reduce the cost difference and help you attend Penn?\nIf you had unlimited money, then I would choose Penn. However, if cost is an issue, then you should really consider GA Tech.\nThe average student is only modestly better at Penn, and you can get a similar education in chemistry at either school. Where Penn would really differentiate itself is if you were interested in exploring non-science /engineering subjects as a significant part of your undergraduate experience. If you wanted to double major in English or classic Latin, take some business classes, or had an interest in considering nursing, then Penn would provide a unique opportunity to take courses in a wide range of subjects at a world class level in addition to chemistry. However, that is a significant cost difference and GA Tech is an excellent opportunity.\nCongratulations on having two outstanding choices.

Yes there is the superficial reason of prestige but past that the overall quality of undergrads it much better. Also in the fields you are interested in Penn is phenomenal and the vagelos program is super-well known in life sciences circles and very well regarded. Penn has one if the best medical schools and hospitals in the world and undergrads have easy access doing research there why helps enormously their med school applications. Also penn is known for taking one of the largest percentage of its applicant undergrads to its med school( i.e shows strong preference to penn students). Also grades are very important for med school and while Penn doesn't have the grade inflation of other ivies such as Harvard and Yale, it has nowhere near the grade deflation Georgia tech had. Georgia tech has a reputation for being brutal with grades. Also you will have a much better social life at Penn than in georgia tech both because of penn's social atmosphere and also because Philly is much better than atlanta. Again Penn ( and any other school really) is not worth going into debt for if you have other good alternatives, but if money isn't a major issue i d say choose penn, you will get a better ugrad experience and more opportunities in your field of interest.

Some students share this through their short-answer question response, while others choose to write about it in their longer essay. Whether through a short essay or a longer one-page essay, my best advice is to remain true to your own voice and tell your story. Admissions officers want to hear a 17-18-year-old voice, not a 40-50-year-old voice.

Colleges have responsibility to not put students in this position. It is unethical of colleges and universities to contribute to temptations-I thing the same thing about closed book take home tests. The onus is on the school to avoid obviously tempting situations. Regardless, the College Board has promised they provide no way for colleges or universities to know whether the student score choiced or not. It may be that the Common Application warns applicants when they check something inconsistent with what a particular college is requesting but I doubt that the information is conveyed to the schools.

A kid with a non-quantitative background accepted to Wharton would probably have been rejected from SEAS due to concerns of being able to cope with the SEAS rigor. Also a super quantitative, nerdy person with little leadership experience, ECs could be accepted to SEAS but rejected from Wharton. It depends a lot on your profile and how it matches the school.\nAll in all, wharton and seas are first in terms of selectivity and then CAS. Nursing is very self-selected which results in a high acceptance rate but nursing students are just as competitive. In general students across all four schools are on average equally competitive.

One University Policy allows students to take classes and/or do research in all of Penn's undergraduate, graduate and professional schools. This means that all Penn's students have access to a world class liberal arts education regardless of the school they've matriculated to within the University and students in the College can take on double majors in Engineering or do a minor in Wharton like Consumer Psychology/American Public Policy/Actuarial Mathematics/Etc. Undergrads can also broaden their educations with classes from the Law School or research with a professor in the Med School. Professors also hold dual appointments between schools allowing them to unite seemingly disparate fields of study in individual courses. These aspects and others create a fully integrated educational experience for students in every school.\n2. Interdisciplinary opportunities- With more fully fleshed out, substantive dual degree programs than any other top school and genuine undergraduate access to a much wider variety of schools/academic disciplines all on Penn's singular, compact, yet spacious campus, Penn is uniquely positioned to offer its students unparalleled access to an incomparable number of truly meaningful interdisciplinary opportunities. And they've been doing this for centuries, well before \"interdisciplinary\" became a nearly meaningless buzzword.\n3. Penn's campus is an actual campus with lots of trees and green space located in the heart of America's 5th largest city. Philly is exciting and interesting enough to offer Penn students a lot of variety in their social/academic lives but not so large and overwhelming that it ever detracts from the robust school community life that Penn's nearly 300 acre campus fosters for its students. And Penn's campus and surrounding area is exceptionally safe.\n4. Research- Penn and Columbia have the two highest Research and Development expenditure budgets in the Ivy League. Penn does an outstanding job of connecting its students to the projects this money funds through the one university policy and offices such as CURF (Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships).\n5. Social Ivy- Penn has a reputation as being far more social than its peers which translates into students taking their social lives as seriously as they take their academic lives. Students know when to put down the books and decompress. There is a great emphasis on being friendly and collegial as students are frequently reminded that their peers become their network in the professional world and that can be invaluable. Penn has a lively party scene that consists of a mixture of Greek Life, Philadelphia's nightlife, parties thrown by various clubs on campus (ranging from the debate team to the rugby team and everything in between), and more. Philly has a ton of BYO restaurants so Penn students can enjoy inexpensive, delicious food at restaurants that won't charge them an exorbitant amount of money to have a drink. But if partying isn't your thing, Penn's reputation as a social ivy still holds true. Students across the board are happy to relax on a friday night or to go to one of the many school sponsored social activities.\nThese are my top 5 but there are many more. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about Penn. I chose Penn over several other Ivies (most notably Yale and Columbia as both really appealed to me) and I couldn't have been happier with the decision. It's a wonderful school that is populated with wonderful people and I cannot recommend it highly enough! Good luck in the college search process  ", "user_id": "100438264", "user_name": "PennCAS2014 ", "user_thread_count": "8", "user_comment_count": "378"}, {"date": {"month": "February", "day": "27,", "year": "2016", "time": "12:44PM"}, "comment": "\n@targetduke1\nFirst of all, Penn is not a lower ivy, more like in the middle along with columbia (HYP at the top and brown, dartmouth, Cornell at the bottom)\nTo give you an idea how Penn competes with the other ivies: In general it is very rare for people to choose Penn over Harvard or Princeton and that almost never happens. However there are a quite a few cross-admits who choose Penn over Yale, especially those admitted to Penns dual degree/coordinated programs(LSM, M&T, Huntsman,VIPER, NETS) as well as to Wharton or Penn engineering, due to the relative strength of Penn vs Yale in these areas. With columbia the cross admit split is around 50-50, and with Dartmouth, Brown, Cornell Penn wins by a lot.\nNow to answer what makes Penn stand out from the other ivies:\nStarting with academics, Penn is the ivy where an interdisciplinary approach to education is most emphasized and encouraged. There are many dual degree programs, many people double major, you can take courses in any school including many graduate/professional schools at Penn. There are many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, there is a program called Penn Integrates Knowledge, under which Penn has been able to snatch top professors with interdisciplinary interests from other top universities. Also obviously Penn has many top notch departments and some big name professors but that is true also fro many other ivies.\nWhen it comes to finding jobs, Penns employment and salary statistics are better than all other ivies apart from Harvard. This is due to Penn having a strong element of pre-professionalism. The variety and quality of recruiting opportunities you will find at Penn, you will not find at most other ivies. Everyone and their mother comes to recruit at Penn.\nLastly, Penn is the only ivy with a really great social life. Penn kids know how to kill it in the classroom but also have fun outside the classroom. They are the cool nerds. There is a work hard play hard culture, however if partying hard is not your scene you can easily avoid that, there are many people people who are more mellow than this.\nLastly in term of location, I believe Penn has the third best location of all the ivies, after Harvard and Princeton. New Haven is a boring s***hole, and columbia does not have much of a campus community because everything gets sucked out by NYC. Penn has both a solid campus feeling and is in a major city, which gives you the best of both worlds.\nJust to sum up, if you get into Harvard or Princeton, I am not gonna tell you to pick Penn over them, cause I am pretty sure i wouldn't have either. However i think Penn is in many cases a better deal than Yale,depending on what you are gonna be studying and in general a better deal than Columbia. As for Dartmouth, Brown, Cornell it is a no-brainer.

While they both win the majority of regular admission cross admits from Penn (especially H), I think they lose a significant number of battles before that point. In my experience, there are a fair number of top students that visit all the Ivies, decide Penn is the best fit, and do not to even apply to Harvard or Princeton. This is especially true if the student has an egalitarian streak and isn't interested in \"Supper Clubs\", Secret Societies, and pretentiousness.@Penn95 \"Lastly in term of location, I believe Penn has the third best location of all the ivies, after Harvard and Princeton.\"\nPenn has a major city, a sizable, traditional campus and the best weather of the Ivies.

I agree that I would generally suggest that a kid choose Harvard over Penn, but even then there are can be good reasons to choose Wharton, or SEAS coordinated or special programs.\nIn my experience, Penn Alums, more so than any other Ivy are likely to tell you that they not only got a great education, but also loved the four years they spent at Penn.

I have walked all over the area within a few blocks of the Penn campus and have never felt unsafe. Also, there are many students at Penn who would be at HYP, if they wanted to be there, but preferred Penn. For example, more than half of Penn's class applied ED. They had not been rejected by anyone. Penn is not a state school (although I don't think being a state school is a bad thing at all). What is a Lower Ivy other than another weak attempt at a put down.\nThese people with critical things to say are coming to the Penn Forum to distract from the conversation. They do not want students that are applying to their school to find out about the amazing opportunities that Penn offers, because they know that if the students have the facts, their school will be losing some great applicants.

And an interfaith coalition exists to promote religious life on campus and to secure funding and increase representation of religious students. Religious life is thriving at Penn and in Philadelphia in general.\nIn terms of \"conservative\" ivies, all of the ivies are going to be somewhat left leaning. Penn, Princeton Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth probably sit in similar places on the political spectrum while Columbia and Brown area bit more to the left (but that's probably a major overgeneralization to say the least). That being said, they're all politically active places with mostly left leaning students and professors. Conservative voices are loud and proud on every one of these campuses though. The ivies have educated some of the most consequential conservative thinkers and leaders in the history of the US ranging from moderates like Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney to the more right leaning Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas types.

My son won't be starting until the fall (he's on a gap year), so he doesn't have experience with any group, but was in contact with someone from Cru (Campus Crusade for Christ) last spring. That will likely be the group he reaches out to first since his older brother was very involved during his time at MIT.\nThe other group that I've heard about is called University Christian Union, which seems to be an organization that trains Christians for leadership. You can check out the Penn site: http://www.christianunion.org/ministries/university-christian-union/penn\nRegarding the culture of the campuses-I can't really comment on Penn's campus since my oldest didn't attend, and my middle son won't begin until the fall. Interestingly, while I had heard that Princeton was the most conservative as well, when my oldest was flown back there for his second visit (for admitted student's weekend), he said that all of the organizations he saw were not conservative. I think it gets the reputation for several reasons, one of which is the presence of Robert George and the James Madison Program. George is a conservative Catholic and decidedly conservative on social isses, from my understanding.\nWhat I do know about Penn is that they get a green light from FIRE, which is an organization that specifically monitors free speech policies and cases on college campuses. What this minimally tells me is that, hopefully, Penn takes seriously its mission statement for allowing freedom of thought and expression even if the overall culture of the campus is liberal.

I run summer LEGO robotics camps at community centers and homeless shelters, and I coach elementary school LEGO robotics teams in the fall.

Since my high school did not have a football team, I never actually played football officially, but I did run track all four years. I was recruited to a few schools for track, but opted not to get recruited to Penn because I'm not sure of my commitment to track for another four years. Anyway, I know that Penn has won 3 out of the last 4 Ivy League football championships, so I know there's a lot of talent on the team. The fastest guy on Penn's football and track team is a 6'2, 210 lbs DE who's a junior and runs a 10.90 FAT 100m time.\nI'm interested in playing RB in college. I'm 17 years old, 6'0, 205 lbs, and I run a 11.0 FAT 100m time (I'm looking to improve on this during the season and over the summer). I'm also planning on putting on another 5-10 lbs of muscle while improving on my speed just so I'll be big enough to compete at the college level. From a physical standpoint, I think I'd stand a fair chance of being on the team, but since I never actually played football, my lack of skill will be a great hindrance. What do you all think my chances are of making the team, getting playing time, etc.?\nThanks.

Even some skill position guys at the NFL combine aren't that fast.@penn2k17 Your best chance to get onto the team will be by trying to play special teams. If you learn how to properly tackle consistently, your speed and size can make you useful on punt coverage and kick off coverage. I think if you reach out to the coach saying you want to play RB when you've never played football before and have never taken a hit, he won't take you seriously. If it's determined that you can take a hit, then RB and kick/punt returner may be good fits for you, but I'd stick with kick and punt coverage to start off.\nI think if you start out on special teams coverage and build more skills there, if you put on some more muscle as you said you would, you can eventually develop into being a speed-rush linebacker, most likely who would be used on 3rd and long situations when you know the other team is going to pass. If you reach that point, you could become be a main contributor to the team.\nRegardless of what position you want to play, you can't wait until you get on campus in late August to approach the team about this. The football team arrives back on campus in early August to start training and practicing. I'd say once you are set that you want to go for this, reach out to a member of the coaching staff and express your interest, explaining that your high school did not have a football team but that you were recruited to run track on the Division I level. Tell them your size and weight and how you're planning to put on more muscle and your 100 meter time.

I posted something and now it is gone. but while I am here...Contact a judge? lol. On what planet?\nHere is what I wrote:\nNo!!! Do not call a judge or a lawyer! But nobody should be speculating about how fair or unfair the situation is because we don't know. Kids do cheat. If a bunch of students say they got the material from Student A, then perhaps they did. But we don't know. But this I do know:\nThe student needs to consider whether or not the accusation is true. Not whether or not they have enough evidence. That is irrelevant. This is not a court and this is not a murder trial. Students have responsibility for conducting themselves in a way that does not result in others cheating from them, them cheating or doing things that lead to the perception of cheating. But none of that really matters. The issue that the student needs to consider is whether or not the accusations are true.\nIf the accusations are true, then there are certain things that will make the situation better and certain things that will make the situation worse. Worse is to make others prove the accusations. Worse is to call a lawyer. You'll never know what was conveyed to the college by the high school even if they don't rescind the offer. I'd not play that game.\nRather, think long and hard about why people would think cheating was such a huge deal. What happens when researchers fabricate study findings, for example. Or when someone who has cheated is put into an influential job, for example. What happens when people take credit for the work done by others. Try to develop an understanding of the full scope of problems caused by cheating.\nThen, go and talk to your guidence counselor about the accusations. Find out about the academic dishonesty process in the high school. See if you can talk with the person or people who are in charge of the academic dishonesty process,. Tell the truth. Try to convey why what happened happened. What pressures did you feel that lead you to do what you did? Try to be genuine and considerate. Understand that you put the teachers and the administrators in a really lousy position. They can't allow cheating to go unchecked but nobody likes to have to accuse anyone or take any action that can be painful for a student. But they can't simply allow it and they can't ignore it. So as it is crappy for you it is also crappy for them. They are people just like your own parents. Imagine how they'd feel having to deal with cheating and deal with the potential punishment and related pains. Because they are human, they also don't want you to have to pay too big a price for a stupid kid thing. But if you are not repent-full they will feel less badly about the situation and they are more likely to feel that a slap on the wrist isn't enough.\nIf you are not guilty you need to evaluate how it is that people are accusing you. Then you should explain that to your guidence counselor. Convey and own your contributions to the perceptions. If you really don't think you contributed in any way, tell that to the counselor and express your confusion about why others would be implicating you. But don't do that if you know how and don't do that if the accusations are true.\nThe best thing you can do is to be thoughtful. Being thoughtful will elicit support from those involved. But being defensive and dishonest will do the opposite. Good luck. All students do stupid things at some point. If the accusations are true then this is your stupid thing, Get it behind you and learn from it. If the accusations are not true then this is someone else's stupid thing and you still have yours coming at some point. Good luck!

I think the chance to take an accounting course as a high school student is a great opportunity. I took accounting my junior year of high school (it was a full year course, but not a big deal whether it's full or half), and I really enjoyed it and helped me assure myself of my interest in business, leading me to Wharton.

That can help resolve your issue. With regard to the too \"applied\" thing, I really disagree. At least for me, I think taking accounting was one of the things that helped my application, as I was able to discuss how I really enjoyed it and had a understanding of the kind of program that I was entering. I don't see any reason to do a dual-credit community college philosophy class over the summer. Unless you want to study philosophy at college, I don't see much upside to that.\nAre the entrepreneurship or public speaking courses one semester or full year?

If you're not as interested in Wharton, public speaking is a really useful skill no matter what you want to do in life that you can pair up with accounting. If neither are one semester, then while the 10 study hall periods is not optimal, I don't see it as the end of the world (maybe you can do gym or health during the school year instead of over the summer?).\nThe rest of your schedule seems fine to me.

They don't mean only enthusiasm or talking about them with tons of adverbs. And it isn't a matter of necessarily discussing them in the essay. They mean a combination of being driven by the student and achievements.

I posted most of it below.\nI would note that AXO is no longer operating at Penn. They disbanded after a hazing incident. No one was injured, but hazing is not allowed at Penn.\nAlso, ranking them is difficult because they have their own personalities. As you rush them, you will see that some fit with your personality and some do not at all, so what is top tier for you depends on your personality, priorities, and interests.\n\"Taking into consideration the most recent pledge classes and past reputations of the sororities...\nTop Tier:\nKappa Alpha Theta\nChi Omega\nAlpha Chi Omega\nMiddle Tier:\nDelta Delta Delta\nSigma Delta Tau\nSigma Kappa\nLower Tier:\nAlpha Phi\nZeta Tau Alpha\nAlpha Delta Pi\n.......................................................\nKappa Alpha Theta: has a pretty specific type: Sceney girls or internationals. Some are pretty attractive and that's why they got in, some are just internationals and that's why they got in. Mostly mix with the off campus frats or just go downtown. Heavily known for being snobby and catty girls. Thus, not the greatest sisterhood.\nChi Omega: Among the frats, this year's pledge class (2015) has developed the reputation of being a really good PC - hot, super fun to mix with, and really chill girls. The 2014 and 2015 PCs brought Chi O to the top. Overall, it's filled with a lot of girls who like to party, while some don't, but know when to get their **** together. Known to have a strong sisterhood. One of the most competitive/favorite sororities during rush this year.\nAlpha Chi Omega: Currently under investigation, but regardless this PC is also very good looking and filled with cool girls. Frats are definitely more interested in AXO since they're under investigation. Girls known to be \"bro-ey.\" Don't have the strongest sisterhood. One of the most competitive/favorite sororities during rush this year.\nDelta Delta Delta: Used to be a top tier sorority, but as of this year, with their new pledge class, they definitely dropped to middle tier. The newest pledge class is half typical DDD girls, but the other half are girls who ended up getting snap bids (aka girls who weren't offered bids by any other sororities). During rush, DDD messed something up and didn't get most of the girls they wanted. Thus, they have a lot of mediocre girls now. Definitely on the decline, but still has girls that are hot and like to party but are pretty unclassy. We'll see where they end up in a year or so with this new PC.\nSigma Delta Tau: One word: JAPPY. Newest pledge class is sort of boring. Mainly mixes with the Jewish frats. Recently, I think they have been trying to steer away from the \"jappy\" stereotype... but, that hasn't really been working out for them too well. Girls are nice but a little plain, not the biggest partiers. Lots of cool girls though.\nSigma Kappa: Up and coming sorority. Some girls are pretty and definitely fun to hang with. Some girls are a bit plain though. Mixes with some good frats.\nAlpha Phi: Some girls are hot, some girls are plain, some girls are just weird. Has a reputation among frats for being the \"easy\" sorority to get with when they're looking to hook up. Girls like to party hard though and get trashed a lot. Could be interchangeable with SK for Middle Tier.\nZeta Tau Alpha: Nice girls but not pretty or hot at all. Sort of plain though. Don't mix with good frats and are not desired on campus. Lot of the rejects end up here and ADPi. Don't know too much about them.\nAlpha Delta Pi: The newest sorority on campus. A lot of girls who got dropped early on during rush end up here. The girls are pretty weird, but they're nice. Not attractive either.

In addition to Femme Hacks, they have established a mentoring program so underclassmen young ladies have an older peer to go to for support and guidance. Penn is also sponsoring students to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference. They also have active organizations like WiCS and the Society of Women Engineers. All of these opportunities provide almost endless opportunities for students to learn, gain hands on experience, build contacts, find internships, get actively involved, and contribute to a growing and vibrant community.\nAdditionally, Penn provides have great coed opportunities like Hack4impact, PennHacks, Weiss Tech House, the TechTrek trip to San Francisco, special program opportunities like DMD and NETS, the opportunity to sub-matriculate into the Masters program, and study abroad opportunities. Plus, students have the opportunity to take classes in Wharton and The College via the One Penn policy, and to attend a university with some of the highest paying CS job offers and placement percentages in the country, at a school known for students who are able to develop unequalled social and professional connections.\nBy sending a clear message that women in CS are important and valued, Penn has been able to raise the percentage of women in the program, while attracting amazingly talented girls who have grades and test scores that are better than the boys, and are choosing Penn as their top choice over many other excellent options.\nI hope current applicants will take the time to investigate everything Penn offers. The world-class CS program is only the tip of the iceberg.
