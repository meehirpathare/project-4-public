I'm utterly confused and lost.\nI am interested in becoming a journalist when I grow up, but that may change, so I want flexibility. I got into Medill at Northwestern (the journalism school) and the college of arts and sciences at UPenn. I am the first person in my high school to get into NU in over 7 years, and about 15 at UPenn.\nI know both places are amazing academically, and I will receive a great education no matter what. At the same time, I recognize that UPenn is an \"ivy league,\" and Northwestern is not, but that won't impact my final decision too much.\nAnyways, my number #1 priority in a college is most certainly ... the people. I want to be around really kind, friendly, and intellectual people who love to learn. I'm not too into greek life or partying. I just want to be around people who are down to Earth, hard working, and humble. I want a lot of friends and a strong sense of community.\nAs of now, I feel like the people at Northwestern seem kinder, but I don't want to make snap judgements about entire school populations. I also know UPenn has an AMAZING newspaper, so I'm sure the community is good.\nAny thoughts?

Medill encourages students to double major in Weinberg (Arts & Sciences). Easy to switch majors & schools at Northwestern.\nNorthwestern has a fairly spectacular setting in a Chicago suburb on Lake Michigan, while Penn has Philadelphia.\nPenn's overlap schools: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Georgetown, & Northwestern.\nNorthwestern's overlaps: Yale, Stanford, Harvard, Michigan, UPenn, Princeton, WashUStL, & Duke.\nIntellectually & academically, both are powerhouses.\nFor down to earth, humble, hard-working, kind, friendly & intellectual people, I would lean toward Northwestern University, but both are full of bright, driven, hard-working students.\nIf you need or crave the Ivy League label, then UPenn is the choice; but, for Ivy League academic quality, students & endowment, both are fine.\nFor academic flexibility, Northwestern is clearly the better choice.\nP.S. If you find UPenn's newspaper to be amazing, then try to implement changes / adjustments to Northwestern's newspaper to match those aspects which you most enjoy.

Northwestern most likely has more clout to launch a journalism career.\nIf you really have reasons to like Penn better (like, for example, you strongly prefer the Mid-Atlantic region to Chicago), it's a great choice too. But don't choose it a) because it's an Ivy or b) because they amped up the excitement of the acceptance by playing hard to get.

However, I don't know if I want to stay confined to journalism to such a strong extent. Like you said, Northwestern does encourage cross disciplinary studying, and I could envision myself pursuing a major/minor in Weinberg too, but I would still be housed in Medill.\nAlso, what I just learned tonight is that Penn has a journalistic writing minor, which, while it does not provide the same sense of community as Medill, which is 180 kids a year, it covers some of the same topics I would imagine.\nAnd, thirdly, I would be lying if I said I don't crave the ivy league label, but I am mature enough to know experiences are more than titles.

Penn strives for 100% alumni interviews for its applicants, and if video calls aren't your kid's thing, request a phone call instead. I'm not interviewing this year as my daughter is applying, I hope to start up again next year.\nPS - we have no access to applications or scores. The only thing alumni interviewers get is a student's name, proposed major and college, and contact info. That's the most frustrating thing about being an alumni interviewer, you can be talking to the brightest, most articulate kid in the world, but if they don't have the stats, essary, and scores for the program they are applying to, it doesn't matter how the alumni interview went.

The least popular or populated sorority. Girls aren\u2019t well known across campus, and don\u2019t get invited to social events that are highly desired. Typically the first sorority that girls will cut during rush, along with another one that might not fit their vibe.\nAlpha Phi - its origins date back to Kappa Kappa Gamma, Penn\u2019s oldest sorority. It rechartered as APhi due to administrative complications. Traditional wealth, girly girls with style and confidence. Thought of by some as being too snobby. Always included in social events across the frat top tier.\nChi Omega - a lot of girls\u2019 backup sorority on account of not having one particular quality that makes it stand out but not having a particularly negative stereotype either. Because of this however, the girls tend to not be super involved or attend social events. Friendly girls\nDelta Delta Delta - thought of as the party girl sorority. Girls are known for going out a lot. There was a chant people did on SNL called \u201cdelta delta delta can I help ya help ya help ya\u201d meant to poke fun at the girls for not being academically the most serious. Of the top tier, least deserving of its status.\nKappa Alpha Theta - very heavily Jewish and not super diverse. Known for wearing all black and heavy drug use. The least friendly of the top groups. Very recognizable at penn. Has had a harder time pulling girls recently due to some racial incidents but hopefully the organization can address these changes.\nSigma Delta Tau - the backup for a lot of girls that want to be in Theta. Also very heavily Jewish, and sort of similar although less edgy and not as good of fraternity relations. SDT had a reputation nationwide as being super jappy and this holds true at penn as well.\nSigma Kappa - a quiet group. Seems to want to participate in the social climb but doesn\u2019t have girls that are dedicated or wealthy enough to make it happen. Also a pretty diverse group, and doesn\u2019t pull any specific type of girl.\nZeta Tau Alpha - somewhere between SK and ADPi. Also one girls tend to rank last early on in the rush process. Down to earth girls but a bit socially awkward. A welcoming place for girls that might not have found a place in the Greek process otherwise.

I know of a few people in my transfer class who retook standardized tests after not getting in first time around. While they do heavily weight college experience, by the time sophomores apply, they only have one semester (and midterm grades) under their belt. Since there is such little college data to go off of, admissions has to look at high school stats/test scores to differentiate candidates. My understanding is that high school stats/test scores matter less for junior transfers, but that's just anecdotal from what I've seen.

Pays well very, but requires good sale skills and a willingness to travel. A Lot.\nPre-med drop outs can also consider entering other medicine adjacent professions--of which there are many, though most of them will require additional training (a Master's degree)\nSearchable database of careers here: Explore Heath Careers\nAll pre meds need to have a Plan B picked out because even if you have the GPA for med school, 60% of med school applicants don't get a single acceptance. Including about 18% of top applicants. (gpa >3.8 and MCAT >95th percentile)\nMy daughters had Plan B careers in case they didn't get into med school. For one it was a MPH in biostatistics followed by a PhD in healthcare policy. For the other it was a PhD in medical physics.

What do those students do with their major?\"\nI am not ignoring your question. I was interested in what others say about this because I have wondered about the same question.\nA few years ago I got a CT scan, then left. I happened to see the same radiology technician in the elevator who had just helped me. With a daughter studying biology I asked him this same question. He replied that he had wanted to go to medical school, did not have the grades, and that is why he became a radiology technician (which did require some additional study, I think). A friend of one daughter did the same. I think that my optometrist told me the same thing regarding grades and medical school.\nThere are some students who have the grades to go to medical school, or in one case I know the grades to truly impress a medical school, but who do not want to become a doctor. I do not know whether this gives them a head's up for master's or PhD programs but a combination of high grades and research experience should help. Some cancer researchers have MD's, some have PhD's.\nCertainly internships can be very helpful. My understanding is that premed students need to volunteer a LOT in medical environments, but if you decide against medical school something like a research internship can be helpful. I have heard of both botanical and medical research related internships, as well as veterinary related internships (but veterinary school is not any easier to get into than medical school).\nIf you go to a hospital (likely to be a more frequently thing for older folks) there are lots of medical professionals there. Most of them are not doctors. There are other jobs that are possibilities. Of course all those lab samples that are sent off need to be looked at by someone also.\nThe lawyers that I know have a wide degree of undergraduate degrees. Based on why I know them the ones I know do not have biology degrees, but I would expect that some people with biology degrees do end up in law school.\nI have heard multiple stories of freshman year \"biology for biology majors\" being tough. I have always suspected that one motivation is to get the students who are not going to make it to medical school to think about other options while it is still early in their time at university. Most of the other options that occur to me are things that it might be helpful to have in mind sooner than after you have already graduated university.

Med schools like diversity of applicants' majors. They're not looking for a class of all biochem majors.\nEven though it's very difficult to achieve a high GPA in bioengineering, med schools love those applicants, too, because they know that these are the people who are going to be inventing the newest surgical/medical devices for clinical use - the doctors who have engineering background.\nAnd yes, you can work in medicine even with a two year community college qualification - like respiratory therapy. These can be obtained for about 10K total tuition, in four semesters, earn as much as a nurse. And BTW, med schools admit people who did NOT volunteer in hospitals, but WORKED in hospitals, as phlebotomists, and various other hospital jobs that require relatively little training to get a certificate.\nThere are many paths to medical school. You don't even have to do your premeds at Penn, or as an undergrad. You can always do your premeds after you graduate. As long as you have good grades in premed courses, and high MCATs, and seem like a decent human being, it's possible to get in, no matter how you wound up with those credentials.

During freshman year, I had no focus on academics whatsoever and got straight B\u2019s, but then I got focused and maintained straight A\u2019s while taking every high level class I could take. So, my cumulative GPA is only a 3.66 UW and 4.2 W, but without freshman year it\u2019d be a 4.0 UW and 4.5 W. I\u2019m confident that I can handle an Ivy League workload because I\u2019m the top test taker in almost every single one of my classes without a lot of effort, but my stats make me look like I\u2019m completely unprepared. I was counting on the SAT to represent my academic capabilities, but I never even got the chance to take it and missed my school\u2019s make-up SAT being quarantined from being in contact with someone who had COVID, so I\u2019m almost definitely going to have to apply without an SAT or ACT score. I know this would normally mean inevitable rejection for most normal applicants, but every other part of my application other than my stats is extremely good and very unique. I\u2019ve started 2 businesses, a club, won several awards in DECA, and have an amazing internship at a tech startup that I got through working on other creative projects rather than just applying and being accepted, so the CEO is also writing me a stellar letter of recommendation that will carry a lot of weight since it\u2019s a very legit company with a very legit team (two Harvard grads and a Stanford grad). I\u2019ve made it clear in my application that I\u2019m going into a business discipline but want to take a non-traditional approach by going to the CAS school and getting a major in Psychology with minors in consumer psychology and fine arts photography while taking classes at Wharton so that I can provide a different perspective to the largely quantitative business school culture at UPenn (which I also think will work in my favor because of UPenn\u2019s focus on interdisciplinary learning and unique contributions to the community). My personal essay, supplemental essays, and letters of recommendation all make my aspirations and unique mission very clear, so I\u2019m just worried about being instantly rejected because of my stats. The letters from my counselor and teachers should do me a bit more justice regarding my academic ability, but I\u2019m still concerned with the impact of having a relatively low GPA and no SAT/ACT at all.

First off, UPenn is by far my number one choice for reasons that I won\u2019t elaborate on because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for this question, but yah I\u2019m definitely set on going to UPenn if given the chance. Anyways, I was originally planning on applying to Wharton because I want to major in marketing and have a ton of experience as an intern for a tech startup and having started multiple businesses, but after a little research that should\u2019ve been done months ago, I realized that the Wharton curriculum, even for Marketing, is intensely quantitative and math focused. Math is definitely the only significantly weak part of my application and of my academic abilities and would definitely get me rejected, so I had another idea. My interest in marketing is mainly focused around the psychological and visual aspects of marketing rather than the economics and finance. So, I was thinking about possibly applying to the School of Arts & Sciences to major in either communications or psychology with minors in consumer psychology and fine art photography. I also know UPenn is very open to students taking classes at the other schools, so taking Wharton classes would also be ideal. I think it\u2019d provide a unique perspective that would otherwise be lacking from the quantitative culture at Wharton, and I know UPenn is big on interdisciplinary learning, so I think it\u2019d play in my favor. I also read about the individualized major option, and I think that might be good for my approach if UPenn would be open to it. I\u2019m going to talk about all this on the academic interests supplemental essay, so they\u2019ll know what I\u2019d plan on doing.

I am currently a junior, but now I am scared. I just got off of one of their virtual information sessions and now I am terrified of not even having a chance of getting in! I am taking challenging courses, I have a 3.9 gpa, I have an SAT score of 1490. I am involved in a few clubs, but no major leadership positions. All my sport is recreational and I don't really know the coaches that well. My community service impact and overall extracurriculars is low because I have to help my dad with his small shop and I have to watch my brother after school. My biggest fear is the letter of recommendation and UPenn's emphasis on IMPACT!! I want to impact the world in a big way, and because I have been hindered by social anxiety and family restrictions, I know now more than ever that I want to be civically engaged and impact my community in any way possible, but I haven't done so yet and that seems to be what they are looking for. I have dealt with social anxiety all my life and have only recently started therapy for it. Because of this, I have no close teacher relationships or mentor outside my direct family. My teachers know me as the student that does well but barely speaks. I don't know that this year will be much better because it is virtual.

I know you loved Penn when you visited, and I did too (current student), but I also loved UC Berkeley, Stanford, Duke, among others when I visited. There are sooooo many amazing colleges out there and Penn is one of many so please please please just broaden your list. Not saying you won't get in, but these acceptance rates are getting crazy.\nIn terms of advice, I would say making a small impact in any way possible is important. Schools don't want to just see you save the world before coming, but a capacity for and genuine interest in helping others is important. So if you like education, tutor a couple of kids in your school that need help! If you are interested in medicine (as your name suggests), maybe try helping out with the Red Cross or a similar type of organization. Whatever it may be, try your best to work on small things and let that build up, and make sure you are actually enjoying it (don't do it just for your resume).\nIn terms of Letters of Rec, reach out to your teachers outside of classtime! If you see something interesting in the news that relates to class, just mention it in an email. Don't spend hours on extra work just to impress them, but have organic interactions both within and outside of the classroom with teachers you like and respect (that teach subjects you enjoy).\nThis process isn't meant to require acute and keen planning. It is just supposed to be: you do things you are interested in and try your best in school -> colleges see if you are a good fit. Don't stress, things will work out, I promise.

Made around 10k, but we lost a lot of money bc we decided to make all of our services for free during COVID. I think we're at only 2k ish now, but the company's decision to make all services free has increased clients and results.\n- CEO of tech company. I didn't found this one, i was hired and then promoted after the founders left for college. We're developing a webapp that curates tutor packages. We're also developing some AR/VR stuff. I don't really know much about tech and development; i'm more of a manager \ud83d\ude05\n- Debate. Team captain of IPPF for 4 yrs of HS, coached HS novices and MS kids to nationals.

I helped expand the team from the original 5 to the now 150+ members in 27 states and 3 countries.\n- Student council, membership committee chair. I try to maximize recruitment, and i manage the stuco admissions process. i also present stuco stuff on school news, at lunch events, etc. Lowkey i embarrass myself a lot trying to pull stunts for recruitment, but it's all in good fun\n- Research.

I worked with two professors from a local state college.\n- Tae Kwon Doe. 4th degree black belt, 14 years of training. No awards or anything tho.\n- National Spanish Honors Society. Secretary.

My team was also top 32 and top 64 other years of competition.\n- octafinalists & 6th speaker at \"international\" debate competition.

I don't think im a bad writer, but it's just that i can't think of any unique topics that are super interesting.\nLORs:\n- LOR 1 is from my Spanish teacher, who i've had 9th, 11th, and 12th. i expect it to be 8-9/10. We call a lot over the phone, have lunch together, work on NSHSS, and i wrote a song with her in spanish that i ended up recording and releasing \ud83d\ude05\n- LOR 2 is from my math teacher. i had her 9th-11th. Probably like a 5/10. I was in Math Club and i did well in all her classes. She and i just aren't too close like my spanish teacher. Will most likely be a generic \"he's a good student\" letter.\nNotes:\nI will be applying to the huntsman program ED and indicating my single-choice school as the Wharton school. I'm going to select my target language as Korean; i'd love to pick Spanish, but i'm not quite proficient in it as i am in Korean.\nI need a lot of financial aid; will that hurt me this application cycle?\nThanks all.\n-DJ ", "user_id": "100823058", "user_name": "Kwaekers2025 ", "user_thread_count": "2", "user_comment_count": "1"}, {"date": {"month": "July", "day": "16,", "year": "2020", "time": "11:50AM"}, "comment": "\nYou look to be a competitive applicant with academics and ECs that should get you a serious look at any college.

Students can also request a leave of absence right through to the first few weeks of a semester. LOA requires paperwork and approval. The Provost has not changed the LOA policy (at least not at this time). Moreover, the Dean of Admissions has emailed international students specifically reminding them that a gap year is an option. I think it's reasonable to assume a higher gap year rate this year, particularly among international students who may not be able to travel or obtain visas.\nPenn Abroad says that each year about 50 students out the the entire undergraduate enrollment (all four classes) take a gap year for various reasons. 50/10000 undergrads is 0.05%. Jumping to 25% sounds high. The class of 2023 had 13% international students from 78 countries.

Moreover, unless somebody is from a very wealthy family, taking a year off without working is financially difficult, and jobs are not that common nowadays.\nEven for most of the wealthier students, the thought of doing nothing at all for a year isn't attractive, either, and most wealthy parents are not enthralled with the idea of their kid hanging around doing nothing for a year.\nI would guess that many of the 10% or so who are taking a gap year are working on political campaigns, If this weren't an election year, I think that even fewer would be taking gap years.\nIn any case, if you are looking at a college which only accepts 8% of its applicants, accepting 10% fewer means that the acceptance rate would be 10% lower. Acceptance rates have been dropping faster than that each year just because there are that many more applicants.\nI also think that many colleges will be accepting larger numbers next year to make up for enrollment shortfall this year. Many will be able to do so, since having a sophomore year which is 10% smaller than previous years means that there is that much more room in residence halls, in classes which are shared with first-years, etc.\nSo I don't think that it will make that much of a difference.

They haven't yet. I f you keep reading the rest of the article, you can see that college service experts predict that there will be waitlist waves long into the summer months, as Penn would rather have another full-pay student in its class rather than one less student in its class because they get more money. In my opinion, based on the habits of other schools, as well as the fact that Penn has not increased the number of waitlisted students or accepted students, it is very likely that Penn will accept more than 101 kids this year. If you do the math based on the NY Times predictions that domestic enrollment would decrease by 15% and international by 25%, for a usually expected enrolled class of 2400 kids, 14% international, it would give about 400 waitlist spots open, for about 2000 waitlisted applicants. Of course, yield could be higher at Penn, but still, that would probably be a lot more waitlist spots than usual. I think that Penn sent out only a few acceptances last week to test out their waitlist commitment yield, to see how many acceptances they should offer in total to waitlisted kids. As figures from kids taking gap years become clearer, I think more waves will come out, starting next week after the 21st. Even Penn said in their waitlist email that they expect more movement on the waitlist and that the class would be completed by late June. Don't lose hope- there's still a chance.

In my opinion, at this point, they're just looking for people that might have had some big accomplishment. Being UPenn, I don't think \"demonstrated interest\" is really what they are looking for.\nAdditionally, waitlist admissions are largely based on what type of person they need. Meaning an Asian male from West coast or White Female in Engineering from East coast something like that. Usually, if a student has a big achievement like (extreme case) gold medal in the International Math Olympiad, the university would probably accommodate them because well it's a pretty big achievement.\nAnd honestly, the admissions process is quite random to a degree. I know a bunch of talented people that didn't get into these schools. I doubt that essay would have made a big difference in the grand scheme of things, especially at such a late stage.\nShort Answer: Just tell them about any new activities if you have any. This isn't one of those cases where it's said something is optional but it really isn't. A second update is really just for people who have something more. If you don't that's totally fine nothing wrong with it. That's probably the majority of people. You don't want to just send in fluff and waste the AO's time.\nHope this helps!

The people I see who get hurt by the college admission process are the ones who focus on one or two hyper-competitive schools and then don't get in. Cast a wide net and recognize that Penn, with an under 10% acceptance rate, is a reach for any unhooked applicant.\nYou appear to be a very high achieving student. I don't want to dissuade you from working hard and applying to top colleges. You absolutely should do both. But you will need to expand your horizons and recognize that there are many wonderful schools out there where you can have a great 4 year experience and get where you want to go in life\nAs a rising sophomore you just have one year of a HS GPA and no standardized test scores. Please do not ask people to \"chance\" you based on \"hoped for\" grades and standardized test scores. It is not a useful exercise. In fact, IMO chancing at any elite school is impossible. The fact is that there are more very well qualified applicants than there are spots available so much will come down to things we can't see like essays, LORs, what admissions happens to be looking for at the time etc.\nFor the next year I would stay off of CC (except for the HS Life page) and focus on the following:\n--Working hard, learning, and doing as well as you can in the most challenging curriculum you can manage.\n--When the time comes study for standardized tests.\n--Continuing your involvement in activities you care about and working towards making meaningful contributions to those activities.\n--Enjoying spending time with your family and friends.

Believe it or not, demographics play a large role in international admissions. For example, many accomplished friends of mine applied to Cornell for ED- they all got flat out rejected. It wasn't because they were all far from Cornell caliber (many won international competitions, started their own businesses, or went to their summer programs), but the basis of their rejection was probably because so many people applied to Cornell. To give you an idea, probably ~10 people applied to US schools in the early round, and at least 6 applied to Cornell ED. I also know 2 people from surrounding schools who applied to Cornell ED. That's at least 8 people who I know of who applied early to Cornell, think about the amount of people who I don't even know who applied (from my area). Now my city is a medium sized city near Cornell. There are two other huge cities which are also within a 5 hour drive to the school. Typically speaking, a cities # of applicants grows exponentially with its population. That being said, I would estimate ~150 combined ED applicants with all of the cities within 5 hours of Cornell. Cornell can't accept that many students from my country, since they have a quota on international students in general. That means of the 150 who applied ED, only probably 5 can get in. ( that is a 1/30 ED acceptance rate compared to the normal 1 in 5 ED acceptance rate. Ofc, my circumstances are different than most international students because I am from Ontario, Canada which is geographically very close to Cornell in particular.\nThis is pretty not to the point, but what I'm getting at is that you should evaluate how many students in your area are applying to that particular school. No matter how good you are or how good the ED statistics are, demographics honestly play a larger role for international students. All international students are also sort of different because they have vastly different demographics. Idk why I spent so much time saying this. This is my rule of thumb which i will soon test out: (if you are also a fellow Canadian, the US schools closest to you will have the most applicants from your region, thus making it statistically more competitive), if you live in a city/suburb, try applying to the more rural universities, and if you live a small town, try urban universities. That's probably how you'll most likely increase your chances at getting in an ivy.\nJust reply back and HMU if you need clarifications. Hopefully this helped??\n(btw all numbers are estimates and the rest are assumptions that are based on my friends experiences applying to colleges) ", "user_id": "100820601", "user_name": "fettaalfredo ", "user_thread_count": "2", "user_comment_count": "11"}, {"date": {"month": "July", "day": "29,", "year": "2020", "time": "12:33PM"}, "comment": "\nYeah international admissions is going to be very tough this year.

Also, don't try catering your application to what they want to see (not saying that you would but I think it is worth mentioning).

I am super hard on myself and I am worried that it's too focused on music. An internship did get canceled for me this summer.\nI received merit based financial need for all the summer programs.

While you are well up at the top of their top 25%, with an acceptance rate of 40%, I would hesitate to put it as a safety.\nUsually, if an applicant's school does not have access to Naviance, as a rule of thumb, I consider a colleges as a safety if the acceptance rate to the college/program is 50% or higher, and the applicant is in the top 25% by way of stats (and for colleges with holistic admissions, has a god EC profile). Alternatively, there can be an auto-admission.\nFor you, I would consider Gies at UIUC as possibly a safety, as would be any college which is actively courting NMFs (such as Arizona).\nHowever, you will only officially know that your are an NMSF in September (though if your SI is high enough, say 223 or higher in TX, you can be pretty certain), and while with that GPA and a confirming ACT score, you will almost certainly be a Finalist, you will not have the official confirmation until Feb or so.\nI would knock about half or more of your reaches out - writing that many essays will be tough. As of now, you have 17 reaches, in addition to UPenn. I would recommend that you make sure to keep USC and BU, since, NMFs get good merit support at these colleges. Northeastern would be a low reach, AND it also has merit awards for NMFs.\nIf I were you, for business, I would keep UPenn as ED, Harvard, Georgetown, USC, UMich, CMU, NYU, BU, and GWU. You should definitely drop all the rest of your reaches. Other reaches/high reaches which are better for Business majors are Cornell, GTech, MIT, UVA, and UCLA. However, you should really not have more than 6 reaches.\nGood matches for you (aside from GWU) would be Kelly at U Indiana and U Wisconsin.\nSafeties for you, both academically and financially, would be Arizona State, U Arizona, U Alabama (as an NMF you would have a full ride scholarship + a stipend). Fordham is likely an academic safety, and they also have good scholarships for NMFs, however, they also require that these NMFs have an A average (which you have), AND be in the top 2%-3% of their applicants (which you will not know until they make decisions). TAMU is a safety, both academic and financial, since they also give full tuition for NMFs, and University of Cincinnati is the same. You may qualify for merit awards at UMN, which is also a safety for you,\nHowever, UT Austin has one of the best business programs, and although your auto admit may not guarantee admission to their business program, I think that you are very likely to be accepted, and if you do as well in college as in HS, you could likely transfer pretty quickly.\nSomething important to remember is that a family income of $150K puts you in awkward position, since it's often in the infamous \"donut hole\", meaning that your EFC can be higher than your family can afford. For example - can your parents afford another $35,000-$40,000 a year, since that is roughly what a family with $150K income would be expected to pay at UPenn (about 1/2 the full cost)?

There are 2 ways one can be admitted into the degree program.\n1.) Traditional application process\n2.) Prove your way in.

It avoids the highly selective application process entailed in applying to Harvard College, Harvard University's traditional undergraduate school.\nAs such, some might also view the bachelor of applied arts and sciences program via UPenn LPS as an inferior version of UPenn's traditional undergraduate program.\nPersonally, I think UPenn LPS is a great alternative.

Typically the program is meant for the those that are not traditional students. The degree you will receive is going to be the equivalent of a liberal arts degree. Even with the concentrations, this degree is meant to enhance the knowledge of an individual that already holds a profession.\nAlso, Penn LPS online admissions process is more relaxed as opposed to the College of Arts and Sciences. 8 percent of applicants were accepted last year. High GPA, High ACT, and High SAT's are needed. PLUS any and everything that makes you stand out. I can see why others react the way they do when you mention Penn LPS.\nOn the contrary, I'm 33, and have been admitted to the program. I also am Active Duty military hoping to have a degree before I separate to make myself more \"valuable\".\nNeedless to say, if this is something that you want, go for it. Do not let the thoughts of others ruin your plans to gain something you want. If you are only doing it for the Name on the diploma, then maybe attempt Temple University (much cheaper/college life/greek life/better chance at financial aid if you need).@anxiousgirlny9 , Yes the diploma is the exact same as CAS. The only difference, instead of it indicating B.A. or B.S. (or Masters, etc etc) it will display B.A.A.S.\nAll of Penn's diplomas have been written in Latin since the inception of the school. However, just as I noted earlier, if you want it for the name on the diploma, 25-30 grand a year is not worth a B.A.A.S. without any other experience in your work-field or one that you will enter (like myself, once I'm done with military I will continue in what I do already).\nI hope this is a good answer for everyone.

You can't get a traditional B.A. in Biochemistry or English, so from that perspective it is not the same degree as you'd get from the College. LPS degree options seem broad rather than deep in a subject area. Make sure this is what you want. Will it provide the skills or credentials you need to move your career forward?\nAs a Penn alum, you'll be affiliated with the school from which you graduate so, again, it is not the same as graduating from one of the 4 undergrad schools.

I believe that those students above are not concerned with that.\nI do believe that they may be a little more worried about gaining an education from some of the best Professors in the world.

It has been a couple of months being a Penn LPS online student and I have to say that these months have been the most rewarding and memorable. In the beginning I was really uncertain about the path I am pursuing since everyone around me just belittled my accomplishments and acceptance.\nI have learned that there is no \"back door\" or \"easy way\" in getting into some institution/university. Penn LPS delivers the same coursework/information that is taught to on-campus students. The rigor is going to be tough and there will be challenges. I am not going to be getting an \"easier education\" just because I am taking a program that is delivered online. Although subjects like engineering won't be offered there are other subject options such as \"data analytics\", \"mathematics\", \"English literature\", etc. it all depends on the type of career you want to pursue. A huge focus is not given on standardized tests, but a applicant must demonstrate work experience and show potential of career progression. The admissions officers are not going to admit someone who is just taking Penn LPS online just to stay at home and do nothing. You have to show that you are going to do something valuable with the knowledge you gain and apply it in the workforce.\nI am so grateful to be apart of the penn community and for taking this program since I wanted to focus on my career progression while studying. Penn LPS allowed me to do this successfully and I am proud to say that I have been offered a data analytics job in Europe!! If it weren't for the resources and guidance provided by UPenn I wouldn't have accomplished what I could today.\nPenn LPS and the College of Arts and Sciences have different values. It is important for prospective students to reflect and see which set of values do they most closely align with and represent. Personally, I wanted to focus on my career while studying which is why I chose Penn LPS. The idea of going on campus was not so appealing to me because I felt there were more opportunities that I could take advantage of in my community. If a student wants to work and focus on their career progression then LPS online is the way to go, it not then they should consider applying for the College of Arts and Sciences.\nPeople are always going to find something to nit-pick no matter what path in life you pick. This was something I have realized and it has taught me to focus on appreciating the path I am creating for myself. Before I applied to Penn LPS many of my peers thought I was going to get nowhere and my goals of trying to land a job was a joke. Everyone thought that I was making excuses to validate my insecurities and make it seem like the education I was getting was valuable. But after I landed my job and accomplished what I said, everyone around me started to comment about how I am going to do bad and will eventually drop out since people get jobs after a degree, and just other belittling statements.\nIt is important to focus and value the path YOU choose for yourself and to not let the closed/condescending mindsets of others slow you down.

I\u2019m a German (former) business studies undergrad and I\u2019m currently working as a sales controller for one of the biggest German industrial corporations. I\u2019m currently thinking about applying for UPenn\u2019s MCIT (on campus), but I\u2019m afraid the GPA of my bachelor\u2019s degree is simply too bad for an Ivy League school. I haven\u2019t had any official transcript evaluation done, but my grade should be equivalent to a GPA of about 3.4 (maybe slightly better like 3.44). However, there are some aspects that might justify my not so special GPA or at least compensate for it a little bit:\n-\tI did a special program during my bachelor\u2019s studies with an integrated apprenticeship / trainee program with the company I\u2019m still working for. I had to work as soon as my lectures were over (that\u2019s when my exams usually started\u2026) => I either studied in the evening or took some leave\n-\tI had a part-time job at that company during my entire final semester, so I had to earn some additional credits during the first few semesters to cope with writing my thesis, taking some courses at uni and having a job later\n-\tEarning additional credits during my first few semesters was also important for me since I\u2019ve spent a semester abroad in China and I had to make sure to complete my degree in time despite that. Moreover, I took two Chinese classes at university (only got credits for one of them)\n-\tI had to study for some additional exams for my apprenticeship\n-\tI did finish my bachelor\u2019s within the standard period of study (+ 1 practical semester during which I didn\u2019t take any courses)\n-\tI did quite well in both of my maths classes (4.0 & 3.7) and in a class that taught us some basic vba programming and database knowledge (3.7)\n-\tAccording to my bachelor\u2019s certificate I was among the top 8,2% of my degree\u2026 but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still okay and if the admissions board even cares about such stats\n-\tDuring my professional training I got the chance to work in many different departments of that company and I worked in 3 different cities (2 in Germany, 1 in Spain)\n-\tMy extracurricular activities apart from my job were not very exciting: I was a mentor for a foreign exchange student for one semester and I occasionally played in a small orchestra.\nThe reason why I would like to hear your opinions on my profile is that I don\u2019t know if it makes sense for me to study for the GRE and request letters of recommendation if I don\u2019t have a realistic chance to get admitted because of my GPA What do you think, should I give it a try or should I better look for a different university?

You have effectively won multiple lotteries. Be happy. Much of the elite college admissions process is out of your control so don't take any of it personally. Being an excellent student keeps your application out of the garbage pile. Beyond that, who knows? As a first gen., hispanic male (out of your control) you had a leg up. Being a full pay student (also out of your control) didn't hurt either (need-blind is never truly need-blind in my view).\nYou'll never know why Wharton said no. My son was accepted to Wharton, rejected from Brown and Princeton, and waitlisted at Harvard. That's the way it goes.

I am a Caucasian female and am in a high income bracket (probably between top 1 and 5%). I go to a pretty competitive suburban public high school in Illinois (~2000 students). Our school is pretty strong academically, but we only have a couple at most get into Ivies each year. There is a handful that apply to UPenn each year, but as far as I know, none have been accepted.\nTest scores:\nSAT: 1510 in one sitting; 1530 super score (I might take it again since I took these early in junior year)\nSAT Essay: 21/24\nSAT Math II: planning to take (probably will get in the high 700s or 800)\nPSAT: 1470/1520 (definitely a commended scholar, hopefully a national merit semi-finalist or finalist)\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (unweighted) and 4.58/4.0 (weighted)\nRanking: my school does not rank, but I have the highest honor roll recognition\nAPs: (I got As in all of these)\nFreshman year: AP Human Geo (only one allowed) - 5\nSophomore year: AP World - 5; AP Seminar - 3 (this was a trial class when I took it)\nJunior year: AP Calc BC, AP Physics 1, AP US, AP Lang, AP Econ micro/macro (expect to score 4/5s)\nSenior year classes: Calc 3 & differential equations (dual credit), AP physics C, AP Stats, AP Spanish, College writing composition (Dual credit)\nFYI: The business classes at my school are senior blow offs that nobody takes seriously (I took college business as a sophomore), so I decided to take physics C instead of another business class because I wanted to challenge myself academically even though it doesn\u2019t relate to my major (finance)\nExtracurricular:\nDECA- 4 year member, VP as a sophomore, President as a junior and senior, placed 2nd and 3rd in Illinois state as a sophomore and went to internationals\n(state and nationals were cancelled for junior year)\nFounder and president of small charity for pediatric cancer (will continue next school year, not much money raised yet and we did not have end of year fund-raisers due to Coronavirus)\nMarching band- 4 year member, section leader as a senior (section leaders have a lot of responsibility like running rehearsals etc); our band places around 4-5 in state for Illinois\nConcert band (in the highest level band at my school since sophomore year)\nDistrict honor band (since junior year)\nSymphony orchestra (since junior year); FYI all of the music ECs are for trumpet\nCongressional debate (only freshman and sophomore year)\nSpanish club and a member of the Spanish National honors society\nNational Honors Society\nI have a small stock portfolio that I manage. I started it in 5th grade with about $1000 of my own money and now have close to $10,000 (this is my passion)\nWriting a book about investment and finance for teens\nWork experience:\nPaid math tutor\nJob at Menards starting end of junior year\nRecommendations: the two core teacher recommendations I want to get are from my AP Lang teacher and my AP US teacher. Both of which seemed to like me a lot and I was a top student that participated a lot in both classes. I am also going to get an additional recommendation from my DECA advisor, who I think knows me very well. When I started freshman year, DECA wasn\u2019t very big or well-organized, and I have worked with my advisor a lot over the past couple years to restructure the club.\nIn my essays, I want to emphasize my passion for music and my passion for business/finance, both of which I think are reflected well in my ECs and leaderships roles. Even though I do not have that wide range of ECs, I am very passionate and highly involved in band/orchestra and DECA. Academics are very rigorous and marching band is VERY high commitment, so it is difficult to do any more than I already am.\nI think that my biggest weakness for top schools would be my SAT (it\u2019s above the average accepted students but still not the strongest) and my lack of community service hours. I don\u2019t know how much community service matters, but I know most people go in with a lot of hours. I have practically no community service outside of the requirements for NHS and SNHS.\nI think that\u2019s about all, let me know if there\u2019s any other information you would want about my profile.

I know a lot of students who had amazing research positions at CHOP and Penn Med, but I found it difficult to find research positions where I was doing meaningful work and thinking critically. It isn't difficult to get a spot in a lab, but I don't think I got much out of my research experience. Does Penn have great research being done on campus? Yes. Is that a convincing enough reason to attend? I wouldn't make it the only factor.\nUPenn is very pre-prof oriented, which is great in some ways and not so great in others. There's a lot of herd mentality pushing students to go into finance, consulting, investment banking, etc. The career services are definitely more useful for Wharton students, but it wasn't bad for pre-meds. My adviser gave me some good advice, but she always would tell me that \"a Penn degree will take you anywhere.\" If you're able to find a small group of pre-med students who are supportive of each other, I think your peers and current medical students can be the best advisers.\nThought I'd share a little your original questions:\n1. I'll be honest. The premed culture is pretty cutthroat, especially during the first two years. Classes are graded on a curve and the mentality at Penn is to gun for a prestigious med school with a head-turning name.\n2. I'd say it's difficult but not impossible. I had >3.7 at Penn and >95 percentile MCAT, but it was quite a challenge.\n3. I covered this in my answer above. It's pretty easy to get a research position in a lab, but it's also difficult to get published and/or build creativity.\n3. UPenn is pretty frat-heavy. I wasn't interested in drinking, and most of the social life is party-oriented. With that being said, not everyone at Penn is a party animal, but it will be more of a challenge to find friends elsewhere. There's not much school spirit either, so you'll have to do some searching to find a group of buddies.\nHope this helps!

I found that the students who were able to stand were often happy at the school that they were attending.\nThe average student at Penn is smarter, in my opinion, than the average student at UCLA. When you're competing against a class full of top students, the curve can be a real killer.\nAs I said, the advising you get at Penn is better than none (you will get little to none at a UC), but I found that the most helpful advisers were my peers and current medical students. There are certainly more research opportunities, but these opportunities are more to check off boxes than to actually focus on innovation. Since you're interested in MSTP, having publications as an undergraduate where you make meaningful contributions is key. That depends entirely on the professor you work with.\nThere's no wrong decision here, as you're presented with two amazing options. Remember that regardless of what university you choose, you will have to stand out academically and emotionally if you want to get into med school. Imagine yourself in both schools and think about which version of you you like better.\nWhen I was choosing med schools, I found that making a decision mentally and checking how you felt about it after a few days was really helpful. Your gut is honestly the best guide for making this decision.\nBest of luck!

You could have been deferred to the RD round and then waitlisted or rejected at that point but that doesn't seem to be the case because you stated that it was a rejection at ED. You attend Emory now as a freshman and have good grades for one semester only and you're predicting good grades for this spring semester. Other than good first semester grades what has changed about you that would make Wharton now accept you as a transfer into the graduating class year of students that you were denied an original spot? You will be applying to transfer after sophomore year at Emory, correct? That would give you time to set yourself apart from all the other deserving candidates.

Even if you get rejected, it's alright. I also plan on trying to transfer into better schools next year-but I know that at the end of the day it's going to be a long shot.\n2. If you've substantially improved since high school, your chances are probably higher seeing as though the admissions staff will (hopefully) take note of your improvement as long as you explain it thoroughly in essays. Also, applying to the same school three times (maybe) shows the admissions staff that you REALLY want to get in. If they have to make the decision between someone who has only applied to them once, and someone who has applied three times, all things being equal (grades, lor, essay quality, scores) they'd probably choose the person who applied three times b/c it's a safer investment.\n3. I honestly don't know how your dad helps or harms your application. It's unique, who knows, maybe it'll help idk.\n4. Don't expect to get in.\n5. As to your most recent question, yes, probably because student visas have been suspended to the U.S. (as well as some new developments suspending immigration). 23% of Wharton are international, and they are no longer going to be coming back to the physical school until those restrictions are lifted. MAYBE Wharton will accept more people to offset the loss of immigrants and international students.\nHere's a nyt article that also might help you understand how the coronavirus will impact college admissions:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-colleges-universities-admissions.html ", "user_id": "100797216", "user_name": "KritikMan ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "10"}]}, {"topic": "Social Work Doctorate (DSW) Decisions", "url": "https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-pennsylvania/2182742-social-work-doctorate-dsw-decisions.html", "comments": [{"date": {"month": "April", "day": "13,", "year": "2020", "time": "10:42AM"}, "comment": "\nMy understanding is that decisions (UPENN DSW) should begin to be released today - Wednesday with acceptances occurring possibly via phone.

I read these boards regularly and appreciate all the information but am now looking for some help. My son received a Penn interview request by email last Sunday at 9 pm asking to meet on Monday at a location 45 minutes from our home. We were out of town (though I thought it was very short notice), but my son responded within the hour stating we were away and asking if he could meet later in the week or this coming weekend. No response for 3 days. He resent the email in case it was lost or went to spam. He received a response today that the interviewer would be out of town this weekend but might be able to meet him on Sunday night. She didn't say when she would let him know. He has had a few other interviews that were very easy to schedule - mostly on weekends and all within 10 minutes of our house. We live outside a large city, so I doubt alumni interviewers are an issue, but does this seem normal? Is it correct that Penn interviews must be completed by the end of the month? Should my son be expected to drive 45 minutes to meet the interviewer? Thanks in advance for thoughts and insight!

Another school in my city with the same name doesn't have the word \"high\" in it. I checked the university's mailing list, and it showed my school's name without \"high\" but with the address of the other school in my city. I guess the admissions committee searched for the name and as it didn't have \"high\", so they got the details of the other school. I know it is too late now, so should I let the university know about it, or wait for the decisions and if I get accepted, then I should let them know?\nAnd if they find this mistake, will they automatically reject me or revoke my acceptance (if I get in)?\nI am the first one from my school, so I am worried about it.

Yes, Wharton will be tough, but it is also an incredible opportunity. There is a reason Wharton is rated the #1 undergrad business program by every major ranking system and that's because it has great programs in addition to great classes/professors. Wharton has undergrad research opportunities, entreprenuership programs / grants, international programs, and everything else. As much as Wharton may be difficult, it is not cutthroat. People say Stern is much more cutthroat, but the fact is Stern students support eachother and have fun... they just work hard too. The same goes for Wharton.\nWharton also requires more than half of all credits to be taken outside of Wharton, meaning many, many courses in the areas that you like to study. Since you are strongly considering SFS, you must be strongly interested in international studies. Penn recently built an entirely new building called the Perelman Center for International Relations and Economics, so you know Penn is investing heavily into those areas as well, so you will not be limited academically. I took an International Relations summer course in that building last summer, and enjoyed both the building and my class.\nThe Wharton name serves you beyond your first job as well, and most Wharton students do not return for an MBA because they frankly don't need it. They have the alumni network and prestigious name already. I think it is easy to focus on the difficulty of a school, but a school is so much more than that. I was rejected from Wharton, but I was accepted into Stern, and when I applied I was totally scared of going, but when I talked with students I realized that Stern is just a place where a lot of people aim high and work hard, and you also are immersed into that culture.

This year I have met some of the most genuinely nice and caring people I have ever known in Wharton. Are there some hyper-competitive people? For sure, but the vast majority are not. People are very driven and ambitious at Wharton, and at times that can easily be mistaken as competitiveness. For me it\u2019s been inspiring seeing students who you know one day are going to do great things and lead great companies.\nAt Penn, a lot of people find community in their clubs and I personally did as well. Some of the finance and consulting clubs are very selective to get into, but in the end, most people find a group that they really enjoy being part of.\nWharton is intense at times and definitely pushes you, but I\u2019ve found it to be incredibly rewarding and an overall amazing experience. At any of the schools of the caliber you listed, people are going to be somewhat competitive because that\u2019s just the nature of people who are admitted, but what you\u2019ll realize is that it\u2019s mostly competition with yourself and you just have to find the friends who push you, but also are caring and supportive too.\nHope that helps, and hope to see you on campus next year!

But I usually get adapted by extroverts :0 so I'm not completely sure)\nGuaranteed internships/research and high-paying job\nHella fast promotions too\nCan do CS and art, CS and other cool things within School of Computer Science that is very well funded and takes great care of you\nCollaborative\nConnections in CSCons:\nMore work than any other school I have on my list\nIf I ever want to do anything other than CS then I'm ducked because the tuition is very expensive and there's no other job I can get with any other CMU degree that pays as much as CS and could help me pay the tuition off (I imagine)\nBecause of tuition, I have to go straight into industry (which ain't that bad) but my worry is that I might want to go to graduate school (but def not sure yet, and could always go back after a few years of work which would boost my chances of graduate admissions anyway and is a common path)\nWeather\nFoodUniversity of Pennsylvania CS + ?Pros:\nCan also do CS and art and other cool things like business/management\nWorkload ain't as bad\nRecruiting is pretty good? Not sure how easy it is to snag internships though, I imagine not as good compared to CMU\nVery diverse, vibrant city&campus\nLots of flexibility in courses and would be fine if I were to do another major possibly because (next bullet)\nThe finaid is better (but I would still have to do something CS, which I would like anyway) and many other majors are also good at Penn, mostly better than CMU, so if I chose to do something else the pay-off would be better\nFood\nGood liberal arts education as well\nLess connections in CS but more in other things like finance (could work at Wall Street a bit)Cons:\nNot as good as CMU for CS (rankings aren't entirely accurate but I imagine there's some level of difference between #1--CMU and #19--UPenn)\nNot sure how good the curriculum is--heard there's a lot of physics stuff mixed in too, which I don't like (at CMU, I could avoid physics)\nSuper pre-professional, preppy environment\nI imagine it can get competitive in a toxic way (people not collaborating, cheating) more so than CMU\nIncome not as good\nSpeed of promotion not as good\nNo chill: student groups and clubs need interviews and such which I find strange and stressful\nCould the job prospects of CMU for not only initial hiring but onward outweigh the well-rounded and less risky Penn education and experience?

Both our Penn SEAS students chose the University City lifestyle and promise of One Penn and ignored the rankings. One, an extrovert, is graduating, has had internships since freshman year, two different campus research jobs outside of SEAS and just decided among top PHD programs. Second, an introvert learning to be more social, had a local internship freshman year, just accepted one top internship program among incredible choices, even I was amazed.\nThe best school for you is where you will be happy and thrive. Yes, the off campus food options are inexpensive and delectable. You do need to apply to clubs but that only prevents students from accumulating a list of activities without skills or participation. Clubs are where recruiting Often happens. Think Amazon, Google, SpaceEx, Tesla. Your coursework and grades check boxes. Your resume and interview are about what you have accomplished, coded, designed and learned from your failures.\nPenn has one of the largest hackathons with lots of recruiters. They also appear at SAE competitions. Think outside of traditional job fairs.\nHave you looked at the DMD collaboration? Art and Wharton classes are common for CS students.\nGood luck deciding your best fit.
