It dropped its all scores rule this year and now allows you to send whatever you want to send. Thus, you can choose to send only one SAT test or, alternatively, one ACT test, and send nothing else at all. It recommends two subject tests and you can send those without sending the SATs; moreover, you can choose if you want just to send two of the subject tests because that is all that is recommended (note, however, if applying for engineering, that school recommends a math and a science).\nLike a huge number of colleges that accept score choice, it recommends that you send all scores because it can be to your advantage to do so. That is because it superscores both the SAT and the ACT, meaning if you submit two SATs (or more), or two ACTs (or more), it will use to detremine admission the highest section scores frrom the multiple tests. Thus, you should send all ACTs if superscoring will give you one or more better section scores than if you sent just one test. Moreover, you should send the SATs if, when superscored, they might be better than your superscored ACT tests. However, you are not required to send all test scores and there is no punishment for failure to do so.

Long post ahead but please try to bear with me. Here's the deal: I got a lower score on my second SAT than my first. I went from a 1420, which is subpar by UPenn's standards as it is, to a 1360. My superscored score is literally just a 1420, but I sent the newer score before I even got it because $$$, so UPenn has them both. On a lot of other schools' applications, I was able to sort of explain the drop without mentioning it at all through my essays - my parents were going through a really nasty divorce in late May/early June and my life at home was a mess, in case you were wondering - but UPenn's writing supplement only includes a \"why Penn\" prompt.\nSo, here are my options:\n1) Don't explain the drop at all. My counselor insists that schools will only care about the higher score even if it was the second that was worse, but I'm... just not sure if I believe this.\n2) Explain it in the \"additional information\" section of the Common App. I feel like this would come off as me making excuses...\n3) Replace my Common App essay - which is about my experience with the Summer Residential Governor's School - with one of the essays I wrote about my parents' divorce and how it has affected me (I'm trying not to be too detailed but I'm really proud of these essays and people who have read them liked them as well). This replacement would be UPenn-specific since they're the last school I'm applying to, but I'm not even sure that's allowed? Also, the divorce essays are quite a bit shorter than 650 words, but I can fix that if it's really important.\nI'm almost certain I'm overthinking the whole thing, but I just really needed to get this out there and see what other people think I should do.

Each sport has a number of slots at different academic levels (bands). The ivys use a formula called an academic index to compute what band you fall into. Each sport has a different bands levels and # of spots. The idea is that overall athletic teams reflect the general population within a standard deviation. That means if a team recruits a lower band they need to offset that with an athlete in a higher band. That being said your best chances are in sports with larger team because the they have more flexibiliy in balancing bands. In sports with smaller teams where their are only 3-4 spots a year most those recruits would need to meet the normal addmissions criteria.\nAll that being said your sport will only be a benefit if you establish a relationship with a coach that will \"sponsor\" you though the admission process. If you meet the band criteria your coach wants and he has a spot, and he wants you on the team they will go to admissions to get a pre-read and indication of you getting in with their support. If addmissions gives a good indication the coach will tell you. This is a very good indication you will be admitted HOWEVER this is not a guarantee until you apply and get a likely letter.\nFinally my experience has been with regular football and a few other sports like soccer.

A few years ago, I saw data suggesting that there were about 140 kids from Philadelphia in the Penn freshman class that year, which is actually quite a lot, but we don't know how many high-quality Philadelphia kids applied, or how many are accepted and choose not to attend, so it's hard to tell whether that number reflects easier or tighter admissions policies. And there are a number of complicating factors:\n-- Penn has an obligation dating back to establishment of its current campus to provide the equivalent of at least 125 full scholarships to Philadelphia students at all times (an average of 31 per class). Over the years, that obligation has been reinterpreted for consistency with Ivy League financial aid policies, but it definitely gives Penn an incentive to recruit the best low-income students it can from Philadelphia. And it often means that for any Philadelphia student Penn's financial aid package will be better than those offered by peer universities elsewhere, even those whose financial aid is generally better than Penn's.\n-- All elite universities of which I am aware have some kind of special local recruitment effort as a matter of maintaining good community relations.\n-- Apart from low-income students Penn is effectively obligated to admit, Philadelphia is rich in two other favored groups: Penn alumni, whose offspring get special consideration if they apply ED (and many, many do), and children of Penn faculty and administrators, who tend to be admitted at a rate topped only by recruited athletes and movie stars. If you strip out those people, the Philadelphia numbers may not look so high.\n-- Lots of non-legacy, non-facbrat high school students are involved in scientific research with labs at Penn, and presumably the best of those get faculty support for their Penn applications. They have an incentive to go to Penn, too, so they can continue to work on the same research. A friend of my children was the lead author of an article in Science when he was a Penn sophomore, based on things he had been working on continuously since 9th grade. He was a strong candidate for any college, and he applied to Penn ED so he could stay in the same lab.\n-- Unsurprisingly, Philadelphia is a hot spot for some sports that are important at Penn, like crew or squash, that don't have big recruiting budgets. So local kids may be disproportionately recruited for those sports. (Also because the parents may be more supportive of Penn because it means they can see their kids compete.)\n-- Fashions in admissions ebb and flow. In 1990, supposedly, there were only 60 freshmen at Penn who had gone to high school in Philadelphia. Sixteen years (and one litigation settlement) later, Penn accepted 30 kids from my daughter's high school alone, and 27 enrolled. (Granted, this was one of the largest high schools in the city, and probably Penn's #1 feeder historically, but it was far from the only school in Philadelphia that sent a lot of kids to Penn.) Two years (and one administration change) after that, Penn only accepted 17 kids from the same school, and other traditional local feeders also saw declines. Counselors at my kids' school stopped telling top students they could use Penn as a safety. But there was clearly stepped-up recruiting of low income students who weren't at the usual high schools.\nSo, bottom line, if you are \"merely\" a top student at Masterman or the Prep, but not a URM or low-income or a crew star, and with no significant pre-existing ties to Penn, I don't think anyone can tell whether you will get a boost. Probably some, probably not a giant amount.

I am actually a parent of two students (one in college, one applying), and I am a former academic. I work in civil rights now, mostly with minority students with disabilities. I really see no difference in a college wanting to have students of XX ethnicity/race and wanting to have students with disabilities, except perhaps that the students with disabilities are somewhat less organized. You may see that change in the coming years. For example, the autism self-advocates have made great strides, just as the HIV-positive advocates did many years ago.\nBack in the 1980's when I was an undergrad, as part of a class on using street theater to initiate civil disobedience, my classmates took over a University cafeteria to protest that it was not accessible to students living in the dorms in wheelchairs. I was amazed to learn that my classmate down the hall who had cerebral palsy had to eat alone in her room every day just because ramps were not installed. If that is not segregation, what is? Times have changed, but not all that much. My current clients with disabilities struggle in college, often with just the minimal amount of ADA accommodations.\nConsider: one reason we value diversity in a college is to have multiple experiences to augment class discussions. As a professor I would be the first to say that having a homogeneous class is quite boring. So now when we look at elite schools we see much more variety in classes -- different races, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations. I see this as a positive. But how many people do we see in these classrooms with significant disabilities -- those who are blind, deaf, with autism, cerebral palsy, etc. I would say that kind of diversity is very very limited. In 8 years of teaching and many more years as a teaching assistant, I only had one blind student, no deaf students, and none in wheel chairs, none without use of their hands. I did have several students with autism, but only because that was an area in which I conducted research.\nMy comment here is directed to those college admins who may read these kinds of threads. They SHOULD consider disability as much of a hook as any other minority status. Let's not just excuse them if they don't.

Your objective is a good one, and I hope you succeed in your work.\nAs someone who is not involved in the setting of institutional priorities, I can't be of much help. I would guess that if you had data demonstrating that this group constitutes a smaller percentage of the population at Penn than it does it does in the general population and had further demonstration based on test scores, etc., that there is absolutely no reason for that other than bias, you'd be armed for battle.\nBut I think that the first step is getting the institution to set correcting this as a goal because until it is, it can bolster someone's application (in the same way that being internationally recognized in a sport that the school doesn't have a team for does -- by making the applicant attractive without filling an institutional need) but it won't be something they're looking for.

But certainly a 3.9-4.0 UW these next 2 years will significantly lessen the impact of your freshman year.\nCertainly an internship in the state or federal congress is a nice resume builder, especially if it fits with your proposed major. But even if it doesn't, anything like that where you can show that you grew as a person and a citizen from the experience is a plus. It isn't just having a list of things on your application, it is how you take selected ones and make admissions understand it was truly significant in some way.\nI assume by RSI you are referring to the MIT program, and if so yes that is a definite feather in the cap, as they say. Again, more so if it links up with your major, but still a plus even if not. Majors often change anyway, so the accomplishment itself is really the far more important issue. And even though that one stands on its own more than a summer as a Congressional intern or whatever, it is still beneficial to take any experience like that and expound on how it affected you.

Yes it is good to have a shovel, but 99% of landlords/rental companies will shovel you out after a storm. In fact, I found snow removal substantially better when I was off campus than when I was on campus - there were multiple 6\"+ storms where Facilities never plowed/cleared paths on campus. Typically they missed areas leading up to academic buildings, but it wasn't uncommon for them to miss paths to dorms! Off-campus, I don't remember a single instance where I had to get somewhere but couldn't because my walkway and/or the sidewalk were snow covered. When we had a pair of 24\"+ storms within a week of each other, they didn't clear a path until midday, but classes were canceled so it wasn't an issue. Regarding his car, though, most students have very little reason to use their cars, and I would advise against driving when it requires shoveling out a car. A reality I have found is that Philadelphia gets enough snow for it to be significant but not enough for drivers to know how to handle it. An out-of-town driver not used to driving in snow is a recipe for disaster here... I'd just wait it out until the snow melts (and then promptly go to a car wash... salt will destroy the undercarriage of the vehicle if not removed).\n2. Completely agree. Jumper cables are key.\n3. I generally agree, but to be honest, I found riding a bike easier than walking in the snow/ice. That might be because I grew up in the city and rode my bike in the snow as a kid, but I slipped and slid a lot more on foot than on wheels! I suppose that's not a great plan for everybody, though.\n4. Completely agree. There is a run on milk, bread and eggs before even the slightest chance of a storm. It's hilarious to see it happen (and to participate!).\n5. Also agree!\n6. I disagree... there are two main reasons to hate snow: a) shoveling/removing it and b) getting around in it. As a student, you don't need to deal with either of those things! Snow removal is addressed for you, and Penn's campus area makes walking the only necessary form of transportation. It isn't too tough to walk in snow, especially compared to driving. Plus, you get the added benefit of being at a school full of nerds during a snowstorm. During my undergrad, the three best things I saw during snowstorms were a giant (20'+) snowman built by 15 people, a snowball fight that included about 2,000 people on Superblock (this happened during a major storm where the trash/recycling receptacles were under the snow, so we wound up burying our empty beer cans, which was a sight to see after it melted!), and an honest-to-God beer pong table fashioned out of ice (gotta love engineers!).\nRegarding winter apparel, consider the following:\n1) Heavy winter coat for normal circumstances (I have a peacoat, which is very, very warm)\n2) Weatherproof coat for snowy conditions, unless there is little chance he will be outside for an extended period during a snowstorm\n3) A hat or earmuffs (I use 180s, which are about $20-$30, keep me plenty warm, and take up next to no space in my coat pocket, compared to a bulky hat!)\n4) Warm gloves\n5) Snowboots (or any waterproof boots, really)\nHope this helps!

I applied to both schools by the October 1st 2016 early decision deadline. I heard back from Penn LPS first then was accepted to Columbia Gs almost 2 weeks later. I knew I had a big decision to make but neither school is known for being particularly forthcoming with the credit transfer process, or financial aid information, until well into your first semester. The only way I could weigh every pro and con to each school would be to defer admission, which was time I was not willing to waste. Instead I poured through several articles regarding each school and looked to forums such as this to try to make as informed decision as possible. In the end I chose UPenn LPS, here is why:\nThe Campus:\nIt goes without saying that UPenn has one of the most attractive campuses out there. One reason I applied to both schools is because of the campus feel while still being in close proximity to a city. I visited both schools and the Penn campus was far more appealing to me. This feeling is mostly intuitive and may vary depending on the person. After living in New York for about 8 years I am excited to be attending my last 2 years of school in a somewhat calmer setting.\nThe Diploma:\nI would be happy with any diploma really, but the fact that Penn provides an identical diploma to its non-traditional students is a good feeling. I have read several articles about the Columbia GS diploma, many students have fought to change the writing to Latin like the Columbia College diploma so it will look more similar to the traditional. The dean of the school released a statement denying the motion to do so. Columbia GS claims to pride itself of providing the same rigorous Ivy League experience to its non-traditional students as they take classes alongside traditional students. So why the snobbery about the diploma? Doesn't a student who takes the exact same classes as another deserve the same diploma?\nNickels and Dimes:\nThe cost of accepting my admissions offer from Penn was $0.00 while a deposit of $500.00 was needed for Columbia. Penn lists all additional fees in the same place as tuition on their website so a student knows exactly what they should expect to pay per semester. In contrast, Columbia includes a list of several fees but does not state the price of those fees. I have read many articles about extreme sticker shock once GS'ers actually realized they would be paying.\nThe Community/Culture:\nThe culture of Columbia, according to articles I have read, is very much one of taking pride in being stressed out. Students compare themselves to others according to how much they can take on at once. Students are also known to start aggressively going for internships in their freshman year of college. To each their own, but this is not the type of academic environment I think I would best thrive in. While Penn is competitive in it's own right the pace of Philly is much slower than that of New York. Unlike Columbia, Penn is not a commuter school so there is more of a sense of community which is helpful in staving off stress.\nThe Core Curriculum:\nThis was probably the most important deciding factor of my decision. Penn provides a broader range of courses that satisfy the core, while Columbia has very specific curriculum demands. I strongly believe that EVERY student should go through the core curriculum and imagine which classes they would sign up for each semester. All Ivies are not created differently and there are many lists available online that highlight the different approaches taken with core curriculums of these schools.\nTuition and Financial Aid:\nBoth schools will readily inform you of the lack of funds for LPS and GS students. Both universities are need-blind, but not when it comes to GS and LPS. So it all comes down to the funding available at each school. GS always offers some small scholarship that is said to increase as you perform well. What they don't tell you (and I have read several accounts of this from GS students) is that the difference between a 3.5 and a 4.0 is only about $2000.00 in aid money. One advantage of LPS is that it takes the lack of aid into consideration and cuts tuition in half for LPS students. I have also read several accounts of people having between 60% and 90% of their tuition covered by school funds. LPS also offers scholarships that are exclusive to LPS. I anticipate graduating GS with about 120K in debt vs the 40-60K range I would expect to be the maximum for Penn. Even though GS will likely transfer 60 of my community college credits, it would be cheaper for me to spend an extra year at Penn then to rush through Columbia. In many respects Columbia has its advantages, but in no regard is it twice as nice as Penn so I can't justify paying double.\nAt the end of the day, both Universities are in the top 10 of almost any list out there.

I have done a very rough analysis based on bits of info here and there and it is more reasonable for wharton admit rate to be in that range. The dual degree programs, huntsman, m&t, lsm prob have admit rates at the level of stanford, harvard and also yields at these levels. Also wharton probably has yield rate higher than yale and princeton but lower than harvard and stanford ( i would bet around 75%).

It is, however, safe to assume that Wharton's acceptance rate is marginally lower than the overall Penn acceptance rate which is said to most closely mirror the College's acceptance rate.\nThis topic has been debated time and time again(http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/14154638/#Comment_14154638), but the general consensus is that Wharton's acceptance rate is usually a few percentage points lower than the overall acceptance rate.\nBack in 2003, when they released numbers by school, that was the case: (http://www.thedp.com/index.php/article/2003/04/admission_rates_drop_at_penn_ivies) and it is likely still true today. Though Engineering's acceptance rate has gone down dramatically in the interim which may mean that Wharton's ever so slightly lower admissions rate may not be as comparatively low as it once was.\nAdditionally, acceptance rate doesn't give you a full picture of how challenging it might be to gain admittance to a university. For example, the College of the Ozarks and Alice Lloyd college have both had lower acceptance rates than Penn's ( http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/lowest-acceptance-rate ), though I'm not sure that there are too many people who would argue that the College of the Ozarks and Alice Lloyd College are more selective than Penn. It has a bit more to do with self selection and class size.\nWharton is an undergrad business school and thus attracts a more specific type of student with a more specific set of interests. It is a small program with a healthy dose of self selection that could potentially skew the statistics just a bit. Thus the competition of the applicants is not likely to be higher for Wharton as compared to the rest of the Penn applicant pool-- it is most probably just different than the profile of a student applying to the College.\nKids in the College, Wharton, Engineering and Nursing have all started their own businesses and won international and national competitions. They've excelled in all of their classes and extracurriculars and gotten great SAT scores. The school to which students matriculate at Penn is more a matter of where their interests lie rather than their ability to be a competitive applicant. You'll realize that's true when you meet people from all four schools on your freshman year hall and have no idea which school they're in. You'll realize that's true when a nurse is the head of the debate team or a business-minded student in the College takes on a leadership role in Wharton Women (clubs aren't restricted to just one school). You'll realize that when [sadly?] graduates of all 4 undergrad schools take jobs in the financial sector en masse. The distinctions between the schools melt away the minute you arrive in West Philadelphia. It's an incredible melting pot (or salad bowl, as the 8th graders learn today in social studies) that you will love. Good luck in the application process.

This is accomplished by meeting a GPA minimum (usually around 3.0-3.4 depending on the program into which you are transferring).\nand, more importantly,\n2. The school in which you are currently enrolled (nursing, for example) is not meeting your intellectual needs and the school to which you would like to transfer will more completely meet your interests. This is the crux of the application to move from one school to another at Penn. So if you are moving from nursing to the college, you need a better reason than \"i prefer the requirements in the college.\" Because, at the end of the day, you can still take all the same classes as students in the college just by signing up for them and taking them. However, if you thought your passion was healthcare when you matriculated to Penn but you realized at Penn that your true passion was media representations of healthcare in a 21st century, digitized world and you are passionate about pursuing a double major in communications and visual studies, then that's a pretty good reason to want to switch your course of study.\nSo, in all, show Penn that you can handle the challenges of taking on a new set of requirements and courses and most importantly, have an amazing reason as to why you want to switch from nursing to the college, and you'll be just fine.

I'd like to congratulate you. That is quite the impressive resum\u00e9. My cousin was enrolled in the British system so I am quite familiar with it. As far as I can tell, you have a decent set of grades. I don't think the odd A in your GCSEs will hinder you that greatly, but you should really look to compensate in your A Levels. It doesn't make much sense to me why you chose to take further maths, when you could have shown aptitude in English/Economics. But anyways, your grades are good.\nYour SAT scores are average at best for Penn. I actually got 2300 and I'm a bit worried that it may be just past the cut-off (my brother's counsellors discouraged him from applying ivy because of his scores. They weren't bad, they just weren't amazing). Now your subject scores are probably slightly under par. I'd recommend getting 790 math minimum. French is OKAY, but Spanish absolutely HAS to be an 800. I'd strongly consider retaking.\nNow, this being said, I'd like to tell you, this is UPENN. Not Penn state. You're great on paper but your ECs are weak and dont convey enough of your personality. It seems you are doing things for the sake of them. For example, what's the connection between F1 in Schools and Languages? Honestly I can't tell.\nThe fact that you're applying to Huntsman only hinders your hopes. If you even consider applying right now, I'd at least tell you to switch to a different major where you're more likely to be accepted. This isn't a walk in the park. I'd suggest you apply Penn State if you're really into that city vibe. Also perhaps UIUC might be a better fit with your stats, or somewhere like Drexel. They both have great athletic programs that you just dont see in the Ivy league so you definitely wont be bored!\nMay I ask, are you legacy? Even still, I think you'd be better of applying for something/somewhere else. I think your GCSEs and SAT scores really put you into that pile of uncertainty that you DEFINITELY dont want to be in.\nMessage me if you think you need any more help/advice! I'm actually applying soon as well, probably to The Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management. Fingers crossed ahaha!

From the looks of it, he's a competitive applicant and if he doesn't get in, it would definitely not be because of his \"average\" scores. (which are actually above average).

But there are some things you need to consider, especially for Huntsman:\n1. Huntsman is incredibly selective, with about a 7% acceptance rate. So no one can count on getting in, and you need a range of other options. Huntsman is a dual degree program between CAS and Wharton. To which school would you apply as your backup choice if you don't get in to Hunstman?\n2. Hunstman is an international business program which requires overseas study, and requires applicants to declare a non-English target language (and which is preferably not their native language). Is English your native language, and if not, what is? You list French, Spanish, and Arabic as other languages. Which one do you intend to target if you do Hunstman. Penn requires SAT II's in your target language. I disagree with the poster above about your French and Spanish SAT II scores - they seem fine.\n3. Wharton likes math proficiency, and prefers calculus. You list \"further maths\" as one of your current classes. What is this? There is an IB Further Maths currciculum, which is beyond calculus BC - is this similar? If so, you have a strong background. If you are not at the level of calculus or beyond, you may be at a disadvantage. You will need a math 2 SAT II test.\n4. I see some ECs related to your language interest, but nothing that would lead me to understand why you want to focus in International Business. Right now, that's a major lack in your application as far as Hunstman/Wharton are concerned.\n5. Beyond stats and ECs, Huntsman requires a specific essay about a problem of interest in international business. That's something you will want to think about.\nRight now I'd say that there are some questions about your math background, business background, and overall focus. But your academic and language background are strong. If you can address the questions and put together a strong and focused application with a coherent narrative and write a strong supplemental essay, then you have a shot, but you should not put all of your hopes on Hunstman because it is so competitive.

For Penn engineering also has a great engineering entrepreneurship minor which is open also to non-engineering students and Wharton has many resources available to all.\nWharton is harder to get into but not hugely so therefore it should not be a major consideration in your decision. It is a much better strategy to go for the school that you think best fits your interests and profile.\nAlso the prestige factor you mention does not really have a practical importance. Yes, Wharton has a better standing within its specific field (business) than SEAS has within its own (engineering), but these are two different fields. This is true for many other top schools. Penn is a great school and you will great opportunities regardless so it is more important to focus on what you are interested in studying.\nAnother thing is that as an engineer at Penn you can easily break into business (and many do so), but as a Wharton student you obviously will not be able to get an pure engineering job since you will be lacking an engineering education. Personally i think, if you cannot do M&T, an more solid undergrad degree and then an MBA later is a better option, but that is open for debate. Also yeah Wharton MBA gets most of the glory but the undergrad program is very sought-after and prestigious too.\nIf you are really torn between business and engineering I would go with Wharton as your second choice after M&T, and if you get in and decide that you are more interested in engineering you can more easily switch to engineering than the other way around. Also you can do an uncoordinated dual degree between engineering and Wharton (it is the same curriculum as M&T but you have a bigger course load because some courses are not double counted as in M&T).
