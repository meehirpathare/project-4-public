I got in ED last year. I can relate to most of you because when I was applying, I was on collegeconfidential more than I was on Khan Academy! Now I'm going to pay it forward in one (hopefully) epic post.\nA few weeks ago, at the Penn Engineering Welcome dinner for the Class of 2022, Dean Kumar said something you won't find anywhere on the internet.\nHe said that there were over 11,000 applicants for SEAS this year, and they could only accept 1 out of every 26 applicants. (Yes, the SEAS 2022 overall acceptance rate was 3.8%)\nSo if you REALLY love Penn, if it's your first choice, if your stats and course rigor are within the averages for admitted students and your parents can afford it, this is my advice.\n1. Apply ED. Especially for SEAS. I can't imagine how low the SEAS RD rate had to have been last year. But it was evidently close to impossible, certainly less than 3%.\n2. Try to get to the Exploring College Options Seminar when Penn comes to your state. And be sure to talk afterwards with the Admissions Officer who does the info session. Get their name, their business card, and make sure they know who you are - in a nice way. Make them feel like they've successfully recruited you.\n3. When you're getting your recommendations, provide a brag sheet for your recommenders that totally spoon feeds them every little great thing you hope they will say about how incredible you are. Make it easy for them to brag about you. There is no such thing as spreading it on too thick. None.\n4. Make sure your EC's are the types of things that will actually benefit Penn. We don't need more smart people who just go to class and back. We need those smart students who will also fill teams and join clubs that actually bring in alumni support. For example, I saw fliers during freshman orientation that they're looking for people with ZERO experience to join the Crew team. (No thanks, they practice at like 5:30 in the morning every day.) But still, this shows that they need qualified incoming students who will fill other roles. Another example, even though our football team is doing great, no one goes to the games. Which means videos that show the stands are embarrassing for Penn. So if you have the academics to get into Penn, it won't hurt you, and will probably help you to mention that you hope to try out for the crew team. Or that you're a huge football fan who will never miss a game. Or that you'll be auditioning for plays. Or will write for the DP or Under-the-Button. You get it? That's why extracurriculars that you'll keep doing matter. They need us doing a whole lot of other stuff in addition to killing it in class.\n5. If you can visit the campus, be sure you take a department specific tour, and sit in on some classes. Meet some of the professors in the department.\nBONUS VIP info: There are three rounds you have to make it through to get accepted at Penn. If you make it through the first round of applicants, (and you probably will if you have the stats) then you've next got to make it through your regional round, (that's where you show that something extra you'll bring to the incoming class.) By that round, everyone has high stats, so your Top 10 Class Rank, your 1600 or 36 won't really set you above applicants in the Top 10% of their class with a 1500 or 34. This is the round where they consider \"What can you do for Penn?\" Last is the final departmental acceptance round. That's when someone from the specific college you applied to joins the admissions team and chooses who gets deferred or accepted during ED, or accepted vs wait listed during RD. (Denials happen in the first two rounds.) Keep in mind, a whole lot of smart, totally qualified, students who will bring great things to the incoming class get deferred or waitlisted for no other reason than there isn't room for them all. Consequently, this is when my tip #5 can be important. In the final round, if your application actually mentions by name one of the professors (or a colleague they know) - your chances would probably be better vs the applicants who don't.\nHope this helps. I know I would've given almost anything for this kind of info when I was applying. Best of Luck to the Class of 2023! (And/or any other prospective Quakers who stumble across this in the future!)

I agree about the essay. No, I am NOT advocating anyone make their essays less effective by unsuccessfully working in an EXTREMELY ANCILLARY detail about football, crew or EC's. (Please no one do that.) If it doesn't fit, don't force it. As for the SEAS acceptance rate, I can tell you for a fact that on Wednesday, August 22, 2018 at 6:00 pm in the Quain Courtyard, the Dean of Engineering himself, Dr. Vijay Kumar said very clearly that SEAS had over 11,000 applicants and could only take 1 out of 26 for the class of 2022. I was there. That's what he said. (And 1 out of 26 = 3.84%.)\nHere's where we can speculate though - he did not say what percent of the incoming class was accepted under ED vs RD. So if a larger-than-expected number of applicants came in under RD, and half their slots were already taken by ED - that would've left them having to reject a whole lot more RD applicants than usual, percentage-wise. Either way, even at 3.8%, the SEAS acceptance rate would still be a little less than half Penn's overall acceptance rate which includes the college and nursing (and anecdotally they are said to have a higher acceptance rate than Wharton and SEAS.) If a quarter of all UPenn applications (Over 11,000) went to SEAS last year, it is easy to see how this could have happened.@Center - um...who hurt you? At no point did I even come close to inferring that legacies and recruited athletes are the only ones with admissions advantages. HOWEVER...(and this is straight from one of their AO's mouths) the ONLY time legacy or recruited athlete status helps a Penn applicant is during ED. He stated flat-out that if you want Penn to give you preference in admissions, then you must reciprocate by showing your preference for Penn by applying ED.\nMy intention was not to offend anyone.

I'm a high school student from China and will soon apply to American colleges. I'm most interested in science and engineering, but also I enjoy studying a lot of subjects. As I'm doing school search and choosing an early decision school, I am really captivated by the history, the prestige and most importantly the academics of UPenn. I really love the interdisciplinary atmosphere here, but I'm a little concerned about the social life.\nI always consider myself to be kind of \"geeky\" since my hobbies are mainly related to the subject I study, like writing codes. Even worse, I don't know much about American culture because I'm an international student, so it is very likely that I wouldn't find any topics to talk about with American students here. Even in my country, I'm the sort of most boring person because I almost never watch movies or listen to music. I can play some sports like frisbee, kayak and soccer, but can't play very well. Therefore, I guess the only way I could make friends, especially American friends, is to find someone who is also a geek.\nI know UPenn is one of the most social universities in the US. Unlike students from some other schools, students here party a lot. Greek life also has a huge presence. I'm worried if I could find a niche here if I'm not social. Would I be ostracized here if I'm socially awkward? Are there any students here that are similar to me? Would I make friends here? I really wonder if I can make friends who have the same academic interests and personalities with me.\nI certainly hope my college life in the future will be happy, so now I'm looking for insights into this issue. I hope you can give me some valuable advice. Thank you!

However, it is your assumptions that are your real challenge:\nI don't know much about American culture....so it is very likely that I wouldn't find any topics to talk about with American students here.\n\n\n...I almost never watch movies or listen to music. I can play some sports... but can't play very well. Therefore... the only way I could make friends, especially American friends, is to find someone who is also a geek.\n\n\nUnlike students from some other schools, students here party a lot.\n\n\nFirst, UPenn students do not (on average) party noticeably more than students at many, many, many other universities.\nSecond, American students (like students I know in other countries) don't tend to talk *about* their 'culture'- they talk about what is interesting to them. They talk about things like the results of whatever sports are in season, what they watched on TV/YouTube/etc, big news events (but not necessarily very much about politics/current events), their classes/schoolwork, food (especially where/when they are going to eat), video games, etc., etc.\nOne of the benefits of going to school in another country is that you learn about the ordinary things of life in that country. And one of the things about most people (in most countries, actually), is that they like to be helpful, feel useful, feel smart. So as the newcomer, asking questions about how things work or why something is done a certain way is a great way to join/open a conversation. And sharing how it would be different for you at home can continue the conversation. It's nice to not make it harshly critical (esp before you know people well).\nThe way that *most* people make friends is by spending time with the other person/people either doing things that they both/all enjoy and/or by suffering through the same challenges. One of the hardest things to resist as a new international student is latching on to people from your home region and staying comfortable in that friend group. I get the temptation (been there): living in another language is tiring; eating foreign food all the time gets old; having people who behave in ways you understand is so much easier. You will almost certainly find some other Chinese students, no matter what college you go to, but try to push yourself to have more than one friend group. As an example, my current collegekid, who is pretty shy and very nerdy, has a friend group from her dorm, a friend group from her major, and a friend group from her favorite activity. She does different things with each of them.\nTwo easy ways to get started as a new student are:\n1) join a club that does something you enjoy. It might be a frisbee / kayak / coding club- it doesn't matter what, and you don't have to be a star- just enjoy doing it.\n2) look for/start study groups. I have been told that this is not typical in China, but in the US it is very common for students in a class to make informal groups who study together, to help each other do better. Study groups can be as temporary as preparing for one test or they can run for the length of the term. Study groups can form and re-form as needed / as the students enjoy. They can be collaborative working groups, or parallel study where people just ask for help as needed.

I would have spent more time on furthering extracurriculars, especially since I only got most of my leadership roles senior year. DON'T NEGLECT THE SUBJECTIVE STUFF because really strong extracurrics matter more than a difference of a few points in scores!! I feel like essays are pretty important so make sure you spend a lot of time on that. I would have taken a writing course to improve my skills. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS MORE DEEPLY. I wish I would have started talking to my teachers earlier not just for better recs but also because the conversations are actually pretty interesting, and they can provide you with advice as well (especially if their subject aligns with your own). These are my regrets lol so hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes\nOther Factors: I only started really liking chemistry after taking AP Chem in 11th grade, so a lot of my extracurric experiences with that have only been started this year. I feel like Penn may have deferred me because they want more information on how I'm actually furthering my interest in chemistry? I honestly have no idea.\nDang the acceptance rate dropped from 22% to 18.5% so I guess I'm lucky to be deferred and not straight out rejected. Congrats to everyone who was accepted!!

If I remember to, I'll update this post!\nWhat would you have done differently?:\nFor my LSM essay, I would use a more global lens. I wrote about life science/business issues in the context of my experience at work (oncology office), but I think it would have been better if it was more far reaching (also more specific!!).\nFor the freshies/sophs/juniors that still have time, I would rec doing life sciences research. I was personally more interested in hard science for most of high school, so most of my research was tailored towards that.

And I would have practiced learning to work more quickly through the math section of the SAT. I also would have tried taking the ACT and I would have taken subject tests.\nOther Factors: I toured Penn & attended their Info Session this summer. I spoke with one of their admissions counselors afterward for nearly an hour. I followed up with an email. This fall, I attended an \"Exploring College Options\" presentation, and I followed up with an email to the other AO too. I kept in touch with a SEAS Penn student I met while on campus. And I listed all three of them by name in the section of the app where you list the most influential reasons why you are applying. I suspect the two admissions officers probably remembered personally meeting me - or hearing from me. And it almost certainly was one of the tipping factors that got me in. It was not enough to overcome having no subject tests and relatively low test scores - which no doubt cost me M&T. But I had mostly applied for the dual-degree program for the chance to have more essays in my application, which are one of my strengths. I figured I would need to give the strength of my writing abilities as many chances as possible to overshadow my weaknesses.

It honestly shows exactly why I should be in huntsman and Wharton. I was able to show off my business skills and understanding of the importance of cultures in business. I think my essays combined were extremely insightful as to who I really am. I truly am passionate about people, cultures, languages and how all of these tie into business. The huntsman was the perfect fit for me and I wanted to let the admissions team see the passion I had that hopefully would be hard to match by other students. More strengths include the course load and grades I earned. I challenged myself every year and took as many ap classes as i possibly could. I understand though that some schools don't offer as many as my school so I was lucky to have an amazing school. But i took 8 ap's by my junior year and another 6 this year. Not to mention I got 4's and 5's on all of them and took honors courses where I couldn't take an ap course. Having a 4.0 also helps make up for some of my test scores. I worked extremely hard each and every year and I recommend that you all try to push yourself as much as possible even if you risk valedictorian ship. I plan on getting valedictorian this year but we will see how motivated I can keep myself\nWeaknesses: Test scores, community service.\nMy scores are low for penn in my opinion. 33 super score and a 1500. most people i see have 35's+ and1550's+.\nMy biggest piece of advice is to do everything you can to pursue your passions and show why you belong. Even with my lower scores I proved to penn why I belong with these elite huntsman kids. If you show passion that will make up for scores any day. Kids with 36's get rejected from the huntsman. I think it boils down to how much passion you display and the work ethic they think you have. Follow your heart and show who you are as a person. They look beyond the scores. Just use my stats to remind you of that. I was worried that my scores would prevent me from getting in. Personality and passion will take you a long way. If you don't care about the program then they will see that.\nmessage me for any advice or questions!

Very few students got A's, and she was ap lang so she knows how to write\nTeacher Recommendation #2:\n8/10 My other math teacher retired and refused to write recs because she was pretty much too lazy, so I asked my freshman and sophomore year teacher who liked me sometimes and other times not, but I heard he writes really strong letters of rec\nCounselor Rec:\n10/10 My counselor is my student government sponsor so she knows me very well and we have a very strong and close relationship\nAdditional Info/Rec:\nI had my saxophone teacher write one to give an out-of-the-school perspective 9/10\nI am going to ask the principal of student activities for my next one because we have a really good relationship\nInterview:\nHonestly I don't think it went too well. He asked me such difficult questions (like if he was reading a 650 page essay about me what would be on page 420 and who I would have dinner with and why, which apparently are old penn common app questions) but I was unprepared for them to say the least. He also didn't respond to any of what I was saying with positive feedback. He had the same response to all of my comments so I never really got to connect with him like I had hoped to. The conversation was about 45 minutes, but it was mostly comprised of him asking me seemingly impossible questions on the spot, while I struggled to turn the interview into a conversation (which has never been a problem for me before so idk what happened) 6/10 -- honestly maybe it went better than i think but i really just don't know\nWriting (Subject, 1-10 rating, details):\nWhy Penn: 10/10 -- I thought it was meaningful and really showed why I would fit in at penn and why i should get in and what i could bring to penn and what penn could give to me\nAny dual-degree program essays: nope ;/ figured I wouldn't get in so why writ additional essays\nCommonApp Essay: 9/10 I took a simple and basic event in my life and expanded on how it really is a reflection of who I am and I think it's very out of the box... either an essay you love or hate\nOther:\nDate Submitted App: 11/1/17 (lol)\nApplied for Financial Aid?

I'm obviously upset, and 25% legacy does seem a little unfair, but it is what it is, and now I can expand my horizons. I am glad I am no longer binded to penn and I have the ability to look around and pursue other schools, but am upset cause I wanted to be done with the applications process. I really love Penn and hope I can get in regular decision, but everyone on this post is so qualified that it's so hard to know! Regardless, Penn has an amazing batch for the class of 2022!\nStrengths: test scores, extracurriculars (although compared to others maybe not), teacher recs, why penn essay\nWeaknesses: my application seems more engineering based which prolly hurt me, not a national qualifier or anything huge, interview possibly, Not being a legacy or first generation or anything (I constantly joke around with my parents about it)\nWere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted into some other good schools but nothing too notable yet\nWhat would you have done differently?: This is a tough question... I have done what I've done in high school because it interested me and not because I was destined for one career, so maybe if I had taken a more business based path? but I really don't know. Maybe I was too well-rounded. I can't say I regret anything besides trying to open up more on my interview... I was trying to be too perfect that maybe I came across stilted, but I can't imagine the interview plays too big of a role. I guess I would have tried to reach out to make sure the admissions people knew my name, but that is a little too over-the-top for me.\nOther Factors:\nNothing else. I know a couple of alumni but i didn't have them write letters or anything, just not really my style.\nI really hope to get in late, but if not I'm sure all of us on this forum will have a plethora of other options that will be perfect for them!

[was also quite complex to find people good enough in English to write a decent recommandation])\nInterview:\nWent really well, the interviewer was 15 minutes late and I was starting to worry I had driven the 3 hours to get there and paid the 150 $ in car rental and gas to get there for nothing.

He was a Lauder alum (Penn's graduate version of Huntsman) so I think that helped greatly.\nInterview: I DIDN'T HAVE ONE. No idea why, especially considering I ED'd to Huntsman and they always brag about how all Huntsman ED applicants get an interview with a Huntsman alum. My guess is that because I walked into Huntsman Hall in October and met with Inge and Marco they counted that as my interview, but who knows?\nWriting (Subject, 1-10 rating, details):\nWhy Penn: 7/10 I did what I could to avoid discussing business, because I knew that if I did, the admissions officers would ask \"Why aren't you applying to Wharton?\" (Answer: I was scared of the competitiveness) I said that from a young age, I wanted to be a diplomat, and I showed how Penn's pre-professional environment would help me become the best one there is. I showed how I would explore my international relations major and I talked about the languages I would study (to focus on Latin America, I'd continue Spanish and learn Portuguese and Quechua - a language they fortunately teach). I discussed classes that I'd sat in on and how they are uniquely fascinating (I think that helped). I concluded with discussing how the diverse and international community - brought together by Penn's Writing Seminar, the Quad, etc. - could teach me much.\nAny dual-degree program essays: 7/10 I think I bit off more than I could chew. I talked about how Peru's cultural reverence for the past impedes entrepreneurship. I was fortunately able to draw on first-hand experience from my ineternship at the Latin American VC firm (where I had worked in Peru) and drop a bunch of numbers that I got from my former boss, but my essay lacked unity for sure.\nCommonApp Essay: 9/10 I wrote about my experience landscaping, which I really think set me apart from the rest of the pack. I did what I could to make the imagery super vivid and really show the work and the personalities of all the characters I worked with. As the workers all spoke Spanish, I included Spanish where I could, but used context and translations to make its meaning obvious. The essay basically described one day of work with my coworkers Juan and Leonel, exploring what we did, who they were and who I was. It didn't ever mention the word privilege, but it showed how I realized that Juan and Leonel lived an arduous, difficult life. The conclusion, which was the most important part, I guess, was that I have this fascination and interest in people. I love to hear their life stories and get a sense for who they truly are.\nOther:\nDate Submitted App: Oct 20?\nApplied for Financial Aid? No\nU.S. State/Territory or Country: California (but central cal thank god)\nSchool Type: Small (260 students) private boarding school\nEthnicity: Hispanic (Cuba)\nGender: Male\nIncome Bracket Range: 200k+\nHooks (URM, first generation, recruited athelete, development): Legacy, URM, development? (I wouldn't say I am development, but my dad is a successful entrepreneur who donates big so maybe they think I am?)\nReflection\nStrengths: No idea. I don't know if I would have gotten in without my legacy and URM hooks (especially legacy). I think the strongest part of my application was the recommendations. And I think that my activities (freshman prefect, landscaping, farming, etc.) were quite unique. I think that my \"real\" job, career-centric job combination helped, as did my academic commendations junior year.\nWeaknesses: My freshman/sophomore grades were certainly in need of improvement and even had an alarming dip sophomore winter. My Math II subject test left much to be desired, and I wish that I'd spent more time on the supplemental essays. But the worst part of my application by far I think was my meeting with Inge. I know that her word has a lot of sway when they're reviewing Huntsman applicants, and I certainly didn't impress her. At the time, I didn't really know why I wanted to study international business. I hadn't slept well the night before, so I lacked the enthusiasm she was looking for, too, I think. I asked Inge what she looked for in applicants, and she responded that she was always looking for a certain \"sparkle\". After meeting many of the students, I came to realize that this \"sparkle\" is passion. In her words, she was looking for the students who would \"pick up a newspaper every morning to see what's going on in the world.\" I didn't demonstrate that at all.\nWhat would you have done differently?: I would not have met with Inge, as meeting strangers is not my forte. If it is yours, I highly encourage you to sit down with Inge. She's really open to that. I also would have studied more languages over my high school career. That would have helped for Huntsman, certainly (I met so many Huntsman students who spoke 4-5+ languages) but also that would have made me a more attractive applicant to whatever school I applied.\nI KNOW this is long, but my mom would spend hours researching the students who were admitted/denied to Huntsman on CC, trying to figure out why, and I hope to give the moms of future prospective Huntsman students some material to do just that and some piece of mind. Even though I didn't get into Huntsman, I still have the opportunity to do an uncoordinated dual degree (and maybe even transfer in). Plus, in the College, I have more room to explore my interests.

My main priority.\n+++++ I know not many clubs, but I was passionate about them.\nJob/Work Experience: none\nVolunteer/Community Service: Do it regularly through Key Club.\nSummer Experience: Literally explained how I taught myself how to play instruments over the summer to relieve my stress.\nTeacher Recommendation #1: 10/10\nTeacher Recommendation #2: 9/10\nCounselor Rec: 8/10 lol didn't really get to know her as well as I wish I had.\nAdditional Info/Rec:\nInterview: SUPER GOOD!! It was so casual I loved talking with my interviewer. We talked for more than an hour. I really explained everything about me to her and why I loved Penn and she was just great.\nWriting (Subject, 1-10 rating, details):\nWhy Penn: 9.5/10. I was super specific on the programs that I really liked and explain my determination to perform research. Showed my passion and that I did my research on Penn. Also talked about how being close to a city is important to me as I am from a big city.\nAny dual-degree program essays: Nope.\nCommonApp Essay: Didn't submit b/c I used my QB App. QB Essay focused on the bad environment I grew up in, but how this has made me even more motivated to succeed and how I used school as an outlet. Also how I want to inspire those from my neighborhood (who don't usually believe they can do well in school in the future) that they can do it.\nOther:\nDate Submitted App: don't even remember\nApplied for Financial Aid? YES\nU.S. State/Territory or Country: Illinois\nSchool Type: Public\nEthnicity: Mexican\nGender: Male\nIncome Bracket Range: 20-30K\nHooks (URM, first generation, recruited athelete, development): Latino, gay, very low income, came up through lots of struggles which I explained in my essay\nReflection\nStrengths: I was really passionate in my essays. Used those additional information boxes to explain anything that needed explaining.\nWeaknesses: There are kids who had better scores than me (36s/35s, 4.00s) -- this shows that you can do it even if you aren't perfect!! I had 4 Bs throughout high school and still got in!\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Just here bc of ED.\nWhat would you have done differently?: Nothing!!\nOther Factors: I think not getting matched through QB and then switching my app to ED helped show that I really did want to go.\nMY MAIN TIP: Work on those essays. I didn't work on them for a LONG time, but I did work really hard on them and made sure they sounded authentic and communicated what I wanted them to communicate.

I do have to say, looking through the threads here scares me since, if I was the admissions worker reading over transfer applications, I'd probably accept everyone else over me lol. Nonetheless, I thought I'd shotgun a few reaches in the hopes that I'd get in to a better school.\nApplying for Computer Science\nCollege: Low-ranking state school (103rd according to USNews)\nMajor: Computer Science, but I switched from Mechanical Engineering last semester\nYear: Technically a sophomore right now, but I am in freshman standing in my major\nGPA: Only a 3.6, but I have a strong upwards trend of a 3.2 to a 3.5 to a 3.93 last semester.\nDean's List last Spring, Dean's List w/ Highest Honors last Fall\nCredits: 47 completed, 15 in progress, have taken/am taking Calc I & II, Physics I & II, Intro to CS 1 & 2, a proofs class, a stats class, and general elective classes\nActivities:\nI'm decently involved in research. I spent a semester last year working with my university's space science center compiling data on coronal mass ejections, and was listed as a co-author on the research professor's journal article. Last semester I worked with the university's center for genomics doing lab work and some bioinformatics programming, but had to stop due to classes this year conflicting my work schedule (which really sucks since I really like the job, it was good resume/work experience, and paid really well). I haven't started research this semester, mostly due to my class schedule.\nI started a club at my current university to work on aerospace engineering projects (like rockets, etc.), but had a falling out with the person I co-founded it with (and my interests changed from aerospace engineering to computer science) so I'm no longer part of that.\nI also was a member of my university's Formula SAE racing team my freshman year, where I did mechanical engineering design of the car's shifter and built an arduino-based data-logging system for the car. Again, since I switched to computer science (and the team culture wasn't great), I haven't really had an interest in becoming active with the team again. I'm not sure how to list this and the aerospace club thing in a good light on my application. I certainly don't want admissions to think I am flaky.\nFinally, I am an associate with a competitive student-run angel investing fund at my university. I am extremely devoted to and active in the fund and currently serve as a liaison with one of our legit angel fund partners. The fund is pretty much the only thing making me apprehensive about transferring, but I know that it's most likely a worthy sacrifice to leave the fund if I can attend a school like uPenn. I am definitely writing in my essay how I want to start a similar fund if I attend uPenn (or at least to become involved in the entrepreneurship environment there). I am looking weaving computer/data science into the fund through doing some big data analysis on prior startup funding rounds/exits/etc. since my university has one of, if not, the premiere venture research centers (whodathunk) and thus access to large amounts of that data.\nNot that I think admissions will look at it, but I think I have a decent github going with side projects from personal interest and hackathons.\nI was also an extremely devoted member of my high school's FRC team and took a leadership position my senior year.\nInternships:\nWorked with an electric bike start-up the summer after my senior year of high school doing wiring and electronics work, and worked at an aerospace startup last summer doing mechanical engineering design and testing, among other stuff. I have applied to over 150 internships and companies in hopes of getting an internship in computer science this year, but my mechanical engineering experience is much more impressive than my computer science experience (which isn't necessarily to say I am a better mechanical engineering than software engineer) and thus I haven't heard any good news from any of the applications. However, I have applied, through a provider, for an international internship placement (specifically in London), and I think I'll have a pretty good chance of getting a computer science internship there for this summer.\nHigh School GPA: 3.46 weighted cumulative, but I also had a strong upward trend going from bouncing around from a 3.1-3.4 until my senior year, where I finished with a 4.20 (nice) GPA my first semester senior year and a 3.8 my second semester. I guess like my first year at uni, I didn't quite \"get\" working hard at school, but since I've switched to a major I enjoy more than mechanical engineering, I've found it way easier (and almost more natural) to work hard for a 4.0\nOld SAT: 1900\nAPs: AP Environmental Science, AP Physics 1, AP Comp. Sci\nI know for sure I have one strong recommender, my Physics professor from last year. Every day after class, I would spend time in his office hours doing homework and working with the graduate TAs (he held the office hours in the classroom we worked in, conveniently), and I've talked to him about a bunch of stuff as well. Pretty sure he's an A+ as far as recommenders go. Not so sure who I'll get as my second though. I might ask the professor who I worked with at the space science center for research, or my freshman english/writing teacher.\nFinally, and I hate to admit it but, I suck at essay writing. I think I am pretty analytical writer (I like literary analysis and technical analysis when we do research for the angel fund), but that translates to a pretty bland writing style. I've always struggled with personal narrative type essays, so my transfer essay so far really isn't as good as it could be. I think it does a good job highlighting things I am proud of, but it's not necessarily the most engaging or vivid essay. It moreso centers around me highlighting myself as a good applicant rather than highlighting a specific story like other strong transfer/college essays that I have read do. I'm basing it off of the transfer essay I wrote for the University of Washington, just changing the school-specific parts over from UW to uPenn obviously. I've gotten it reviewed by a good amount of people, and it's certainly come a LONG way since I first wrote it, but it's still not great in my eyes.

It is only a reason to transfer.\n1) Know and be able to clearly articulate \"Why Penn?\". You haven't indicated why you think it is a fit for you, and you a fit for them.\n2) As a transfer, you have to make a statement of academic excellence demonstrated by your coursework and GPA - universities don't weigh the extra curriculars in the same way they do for incoming freshman. You have an above average but not great GPA from a university that accepts 79% of its students, and where the average SAT score was 1650 and HS GPA 3.47. That's not a very competitive school, and I think they'd expect you to be hitting it out of the park there in order to be able to take on the rigorous coursework at Penn. You'd be applying into a student body with an average 3.91 HS GPA, SAT scores averaging 2200, and were in the top 10% of the applicant pool.\n3) Colleges want transfer students who know what they are majoring in and have taken enough coursework to be on track to meet the requirements of that major. I can't really tell if you've done that or not, but you'll know obviously!\n3) I assume you've done your research on transferring to Penn - they take very few students junior year, and are very selective in accepting transfer course credits - an overarching concern is the students ability to graduate on time with the credits they have combined with the core and major requirements at Penn.\nI hope this doesn't come off as being critical, truly. Just trying to give you the honest answer you asked for. I completely understand the frustration of being at a place that isn't the right fit, and I hope you can transfer to a great place that will challenge you and where you will thrive. My initial thoughts when reading your post were that you should look for schools that really are a better fit for you academically and socially. If you are just throwing your at in the ring then go for it, but if you are really focusing on transferring, I think you'll be happier looking at universities that offer great CS programs, who have a record of increased admissions rates for transfers, and where your grades and GPA are better reflected in the student body you hope to join.\nHere is a list of schools and their transfer acceptance rate, to give you an idea or your chances. Then check out their CS programs. Finally, look up their academic metrics and see where you fall.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/05/20/looking-to-change-schools-these-top-universities-take-the-most-transfer-students/?utm_term=.2553c09e5bc6\nBest of luck on your search and acceptances!

UPenn is obviously a huge reach for me, but my mindset is that the only way I know for sure that I won't get in is if I don't apply. I'm definitely working on finding uPenn specific things outside of student orgs and classes to mention in my \"why UPenn\" section.\nI think one of the tough things for me GPA wise is that I haven't felt challenged at my current school so I haven't had the motivation (for the most part) to try harder, if that makes sense. I think that's changed now that I am a computer science major (the 3.93 was my first semester in the CS program). I wish there was an easy way of saying \"I just didn't get it\" in regards to my poor GPA (I feel like I hadn't developed the right school skills until now) but I don't really know what to say other than \"I get that I need and want work harder now\". I was actually considering medschool for a while which gave me motivation to work for a high GPA but I don't think I'll be going that route. I don't want to mention that though since I want to sound confident in my choice in CS. I am considering grad school for CS however, so maybe I can spin the GPA part to say something about that. But I think my drive to get a good GPA now really just comes from personal interest rather than as a necessity for gradschool. To be honest, I wasn't sure I could ever get anything above a 3.5 (due to a lack of work ethic and motivation), but my last semester definitely proved me wrong.\nIf it works this way, I'll be applying as a sophomore transfer since I'm in freshman standing in computer science. Since I have finished my GE classes, I've been using my extra space in my schedule to take higher level classes in my major.\nI'll take a look at the list you posted. I'm pretty fed up with the lack of quality students and the school's approach to academia vs. being an attractive school for students (the partyschool environment is definitely not for me) but I don't think I'd switch unless I'd be going somewhere with a truly elite program (like UPenn or UW).

My guess is that if you do not feel the curriculum is challenging enough for you, Penn would want to see proof of that with stellar grades and GPA. You're saying UNH is too easy for you, but your academic stats don't support that story. You'll need to better address that disconnect to be successful, I think.\nUPenn will also take into consideration your high school GPA and test scores, in addition to your college transcripts. And - I could be wrong - but I don't think they'll consider you as a rising sophomore just because that is where your your major falls. I think they'll see you as a junior not on track to meet your gen ed and major requirements - you should call and ask them before going through the application effort.\nUWashington seems like a great fit, and Cornell takes in more students as transfers than any other Ivy.\nI am a firm believer in \"nothing ventured, nothing gained' but the application process is time consuming and stressful and you may want take a balanced approach after gathering specific info on Penn's requirements, and check out threads here on 2018 ED results as well as 2017 transfer results.

The fact that you're first generation will help excuse your high school performance a lot as well I think, you likely didn't have the same guidance in high school a lot of other applicants did, and admissions will understand that.\nBest of luck my mans ", "user_id": "100434299", "user_name": "Neurophile ", "user_thread_count": "0", "user_comment_count": "87"}, {"date": {"month": "March", "day": "13,", "year": "2018", "time": "9:06PM"}, "comment": "\n@Neurophile I think you\u2019ve taken a really thoughtful approach to your transfer process.

See @Learnnewstuff's post. And with regards to the extension, I was talking about students asking for an extension for deciding on Penn. The tuition deposit, if I remember correctly, was due a week after decisions came out. Many people wanted to wait on financial aid before they submitted the deposit (which was nonrefundable), so they asked Penn for an extension.\nTo your point about statistics about FA for transfer students. You are correct, I do not have that information. However, there are only 150 incoming transfers for each class. I get to know each individual relatively well, and I can tell you that Penn's financial aid plays a significant role in people's decisions to transfer here.

It also eliminates SAT/ACT/GPAs from their stats for students whose scores may presumably be lower, and college rankings are based in part on those stats, so rank improves as well. I guess I'm just saying that of the ivies, Cornell is the only one where there may be some benefit to being a transfer ...

The Admissions Committee recognizes your academic and extracurricular achievement and looks forward to welcoming you to the Penn family.\nWe hope this early evaluation will help you plan your next steps in the college admission process, and take those steps with confidence. In the past, nearly all recipients of this letter were admitted.\nYou are uniquely suited to thrive at Penn, and I look forward to informing you of your official decision in May.\"\nI didn't mean to be evasive, but I worried that posting details would not be appropriate and probably frowned upon by admissions until it was official. I came on this board to see what I could learn about Likely Letters and the transfer process. To your point once, there is a lot of anxiety around college decisions. I just wanted learn as much as I could to prepare for whatever outcome.\nShe was unofficially recruited at Harvard last year which, she learned the hard way, is not at all uncommon, and is not a thing. She applied to UPenn RD and got waistlisted. Penn has been her top choice due to her major but the extra support at H seemed worth redirecting. She applied to Penn this year and then reached out to their coach, and that's what prompted the letter. She's a strong student and athlete, so she is a good overall fit for Penn.\nAlso wanted to mention that she is not at UConn, but coincidentally at Trinity - so she is in CT!

UConn did not have the means to provide me with the proper accommodations, and as a result, my first year of college was way more difficult than it needed to be.\nI took a chance sharing extensive information and details about how dyscalculia affects my ability to learn, but I think that may have been a mistake.

Our goal in life is to become fashion designers and create our own clothing label/design house. We didn't want to go to art school like so many others and become too relaxed. I don't believe they teach you very much at those schools either.\nI think you would have to read my essay to fully understand my reasons for Wharton, but essentially, we wanted to gain the business knowledge to put our creative minds into action and Wharton seemed like the best way to do that.\nWe knew that Penn would have the means to help us with our disability, so we looked at the math-based curriculum as a manageable challenge. I should not have said that math is nearly \"impossible\". When people with dyscalculia are taught in the traditional way, math is nearly impossible. However, when it is taught in a way conducive to the way my brain is wired, math can be a joy. Think of it as a less extreme case of a blind person learning to read without brail.
