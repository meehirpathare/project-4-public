I know Penn does not typically match with students whose EFC is more than $500. Mine is roughly 2 grand. For Questbridge I have two good recs from my Spanish teacher and history teacher. However, my interest is in Science. On the Common App, I'd have a rec from my neuroscience/biology teacher and an English Teacher. Plus, I feel like my common app essay is stronger. On Questbridge, I also ranked Princeton and Yale but my main goal is to be accepted into Penn. My main fear is that I'd not get matched and have to go the RD pool. Any advice??

I'm also a senior using QB to try to get to Penn. I contemplated ranking Yale and Princeton as backups but only ranked Penn.

I think as long as your Penn supplement is great, you should be fine, but do what's best for your application. Go with whichever teacher recommendations you feel are stronger. Good luck!

I have the strongest academics from any applicant to Penn I've ever seen in terms of consistent AP test score performance (5s). Strong standardized test scores. Good Wharton essay. I impressed my recommenders.\nWeaknesses: No recognition beyond county level. I didn't like my essays that much. While I was a legacy, my family ain't rich and we are NOT the type of legacy family that donates enough to be a definite yes.\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: My geographic location, demonstration of consistent effort through consistent AP test excellence, my already-demonstrated strength in calculus (both AP Calcs taken and scored 5 on junior year), my Wharton and Common App essays, and my reccs.\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Nowhere yet. I applied to a local state school and Babson early. I had planned to apply to Princeton, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Carnegie-Mellon, and several others if deferred or rejected.\nGeneral Comments: I came to hate the college application process this year. I agree with many of the people - adults and students alike - that say it needs to be reformed. I didn't really think about my college resume (I know that word needs accent marks, but my keyboard is old) until this year. I just held myself to a high standard of academic excellence. I'm glad the University seemed to recognize that, but the stress I was in leading up to my acceptance was huge. I think the process needs reform. If you're a reader applying for the ED Penn Class of 2022: I recommend writing as many OTHER college essays as possible in between the date they tell you when the decision will come out and the date the decision comes out. It is that silver lining of time and lack-of-stress that I feel provided for some of my best essays, which I ironically now have no use for. Furthermore, if you're an applicant that is reading the College Confidential page but hasn't made an account for it - you're exactly as I was at that point. I only made an account to post this for future and present applicants to read and learn from. Do not worry. Life will go on. Whatever you do, don't skip school the day or week before results come. That only encourages you to define the level of effort and value your academics are worth by your admission or lack thereof into Penn. I checked my admissions result in the middle of a marching band rehearsal - being accepted, I celebrated with my friends. Had I been denied, we'd still be playing music together as a family. As a final point: I was accepted without having founded a company, interned at a firm for six months, won any state or larger awards, nor done anything particularly flashy. I exceeded academically and locally as best I could, and I was rewarded with an acceptance. That's the best any of us can do.

A tip to current juniors who are terrified right now reading through these college confidential threads; I was exactly where you are a year ago.

I have friends who got into Penn who pursued very different tracks than I did. If there is something that you like, just commit yourself to it and try to somehow use it to help the community, because admissions officers say they really are starting to care more and more about community involvement. Don't ever feel like you need a certain SAT score or GPA or number of ECs, just make sure you spend a lot of time working and working well. Also, I didnt realize until this year, basically whatever you do, you can find a way to put in college apps so never feel like doing something won't count.

I wasn't involved in a lot of extracurriculars, but I did put a lot of energy into the things I loved to do (ie: church- 9 hrs week avg, excluding mission training etc) and I found ways to impact my community with the gifts/ interests I have.

Definitely one of the best things I've written, and it talked about my love for the environment using anecdotes from my childhood (when I organized fundraising bakesales/ garage sales in Grade 5) and throughout high school, comparing my passion to an overarching painting/art metaphor (cliche i know lol). Not really sure how to describe it but I thought it was creative, flowed well, and worked.\nSupplementary: 7/10, Nothing too special, but was still well-written and well thought through.

She was also an advisor for an environmental non-profit I started and organized a 14-day Europe trip that I went on in Grade 10. She was basically a life mentor and good friend and let me read it over. It was glowing and super thorough with lot's of anecdotes and concrete examples to demonstrates my characteristics.\nCounselor Rec: 8.5/10, I actually had my counselor as my gym teacher in Grade 9 so he knew me better than most counselors. I didn't read it over, but I assume it was probably pretty generic.

It is a horrible soul-sucking experience full of stress, all-nighters, coffee/ redbull, endless sacrifices to study/ work, dumb standardized tests, and false rumours/ misconceptions that just perpetuate everyone's stress and ughhh I'm so glad I'm done with it all. Generic advice but find something you love and go for it. Focus your application around your passion and prove how you can make a difference in their school community. Work hard, don't be afraid to be creative on your application, quantify your accomplishments when possible, and go into the experience expecting nothing, because in the end Ivy League admissions is all just a lottery and I happened to get lucky.

THIS IS THE REAL REASON WHY I MADE THIS POST. If you look at my stats, they pale in comparison to some of the amazing students that have posted on this thread. When I went to a UPenn college fair, there were papers that said a Chem Subject Test was strongly recommended for the nursing track. Since I haven't taken chem since sophomore year and didn't know I wanted to be a nurse until this year, there was no way I could take it. And yet... I still got in. I still got in with a pretty average gpa and few leadership positions. And in no way am I bragging about this - I'm extremely grateful for this acceptance and I know that there are a bunch of qualified students who could also be where I am. But to future applicants who read this - know that THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE. No matter how low it is.

I sent in an art portfolio with my culturally inspired sculptures, and sent an 'applicant update' with a pdf of a school newspaper article I wrote on how schools kill student creativity. Good hooks. Solid essays (spent a lot of time on those).\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Applied ED.\nGeneral Comments : Applying through Huntsman, even though I didn't get in, may have assisted me with admission to Wharton with below avg math scores. Also, when picking my senior yr course load, I did not want to take multi variable calculus. My counselor contacted Penn and met with Penn admissions people on my behalf to see whether this would be acceptable (I know he's amazing). This showed interest early on. Know that it is possible to get in with sucky math scores, even as an Asian Female. I'm super thrilled.\nTips for other people? Do unique activities. Penn wants to see initiative. They also take into account environment. If you come from a humble background, they want to see you do everything you can with the resources you have. But this also means that if you're a rich white male you have to really do something impressive to stand out b/c you have more resources. Be genuine in your essays, and know that there is no one 'right' essay. My sibling's UPenn essay was completely different than mine. If you have some artistic ability send a portfolio. Don't let CC posters scare you; the art doesn't have to be world class amazing. Good Luck to all RD!

Didn't see, but I suspect they were phenomenal because I participated a lot in the class and made some deep insights.\nTeacher Rec #2: non-AP Spanish. Didn't see, but I suspect they were phenomenal because my spanish teacher seemed to like me as a person, told me that I was conscientious, heard me make insightful comments/connections in her class, and saw much creativity in my work.\nCounselor Rec: Didn't see.\nAdditional Rec: Came from my employers.\nInterview: It went extremely well. I talked about my interest in service (improving the world through business) and in tech-related business in particular. Demonstrated compassion and insightful thought. By the end of the interview, the interviewer wasn't even asking questions (it was a flowing, natural conversation).

My employment, I suspect, is quite significant as mainly COLLEGE seniors/juniors take these jobs. It also helps too that I drew unique insights from my work.\nWeaknesses: Weaker than average scores and GPA for Wharton applicants. Weaker than average course load for Wharton applicants. Relatively few extracurriculars (in quantity). Lack of super-specialized ECs (ex. a national award). Weaker than average AP scores.\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: My character was reflected well in the app, and I suspect that it would be one that fits business very well. My employment further solidifies my passion in business. I suspect that this is important because Wharton is very specialized, in business, and thus wants someone who'll use what they learned in that school to change the real world (a job would be a sign of someone being likely to do this). The fact that one of my jobs was paid also helps, as it tells Wharton that I provided some real contribution to the company I worked in. My app also made it clear what I want to do with business- improve the larger world around me through the proliferation and development of technology.\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: None (This is the first app I got back)\nGeneral Comments: I'm extremely happy to get in. For future Wharton applicants, my recommendation is to demonstrate passion and character in your apps. Getting a job or two will also be a significant boost. As for grades, SATs, and course load: I believe that there's a basic threshold to pass to be considered. Once that threshold is crossed, however, it won't matter too much. My advice is to get good grades but don't be crazy about them- explore your interests and passions instead.

(In the IB Program 7-12 grade)\nWeaknesses: obviously my GPA and ACT and SAT II test scores, it was a long shot to begin with and on top of that their ED numbers nearly TRIPLED this year!!!!\nWhy you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I'm just being real: Pretty sure they just looked at my test scores and GPA and threw my application in the trash because IN ALL HONESTY if admissions had read my essays and recs I am 99% positive I would have been deferred AT LEAST. I really believed Penn was going to be one of those crazy good schools that were true to what they said when they said the decision was based on a holistic review, but it is certain now that it is not true.\nWhere else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted (Florida State University, Florida Institute of Technology) Waiting (Tulane University, University of Florida, and Syracuse University)\nGeneral Comments : I am beyond shocked that Penn did not defer me, I was expecting a no, but thought my essays would give me a serious shot at acceptance and deferment. I am embarrassed of my GPA as many people will say that it isn't that high, but as an 8th and 9th grader I let my grades slip and accepted Bs as okay when I didn't have time to achieve an A as I really did think I was going to play volleyball in college and I was told athletes could achieve an acceptance with a slightly lower GPA than other applicants. I regret it but hey, I can't change it. I was just hoping. Now I am eager for an acceptance to Tulane as I am in love with the school and new that Penn was a long shot. Also I did get an A in an advanced Psychology class at a private university where I live (Florida Tech) when I was in 9th grade (not dual enrollment as I had to be admitted by FIT when I was in 9th grade to take a college course there). So I don't feel that my HS GPA accurately reflects my achievement in college. So I know I'm ranting but I am not trying to come off as arrogant, I am simply in disbelief that the application review is truly HOLISITIC.

The Clark Scholars Program will provide financial aid and create a new academic program for undergraduate engineering students.\nThe gift honors the late A. James Clark, former CEO of Clark Enterprises and Clark Construction Group LLC, one of the country\u2019s largest privately-held general building contractors. It is designed to prepare future engineering and business leaders, with an emphasis on low income families and first-generation college students.\nThe program will enroll ten students per incoming class, with recruitment underway for the first cohort beginning in fall 2018. Clark Scholars pursue rigorous engineering coursework, take at least two business classes, volunteer in community service activities and participate in enrichment seminars and events with leaders in the field. Scholars will also engage in personalized mentoring, research projects and innovation training.

You don't have poor scores in reading/writing, you are just too capable with maths. You almost have no mistakes in sat math(not sat2 subject maths), so therefore I assume you can analyze facts and data with a better level and almost neutral rationality. You are suppose to do research on this topic and come to a conclusion on your own, but now you throw back another question. Ok, fine. Let's go one more round.\nSince this is an ivy forum, we need to narrow down and need a little focus on the set. One thing I cannot emphasis enough about is the big differences % these two engineering schools. Not counting one fact is they are dead set rivals on all major ivy sports events. These two schools are like 2 sides of the coin that they will never see the beauty of the other sides, and they intended not to be.\nOne is very aggressively steered by a new engineering school dean and very positively believes his school is at the beginning of a golden age. New faculties are recruited in major fields and reach 150 strong in the next 2-3 years. Even though it is still moderate when compared to their giant business school which has over 200+ professors. New bioengineering building, nanotechnology lab, computer central quad, and innovation labs all in these several years.\nAll new research are targeted at merging scientific fields of medicine, nanotechnology and computing. Combining with strong supports from physics, chem, and biomedical, and mathematics. Scientific computing and applied math are used for further enhancing the strength of this engineering school.\nThe other elite engineering school is built on a second to none campus setting. Every incoming student is well taken care and will be provided with the best resources and faculty advice. Even in a smaller scale, but is a much more focused and tailored made for each talented student. However, this school allows no double major like the other one, not encourage to have so called minor but provide you with a certificate to highlight your secondary field. Recent focus moved onto financial engineering ( combining operation research/civil engineering) and the other top school followed ( Cmu, Columbia etc., and Stanford called that management sciences and engineering). All efforts are used to pull top candidates from the other famed business school or rival the famous M & T program. Their liberal arts setting and balance for their engineearing education is at the very top. And therefore, do me a favor not to rank these two schools, but to love them one way or the other. I do hope that you can get accepted either way.

I give kudos to most colleges which have greatly ramped up the mental health resources on campuses in the past decade. The demand is staggering and at times overwhelming. Colleges didn't create this issue - students often arrive on campus with depression/anxiety already or they develop them once there for reasons not connected to the college (the age range plays a role for sure). Good for the colleges for recognizing it and providing basic supports. It is a huge financial burden to the schools to do so and doesn't replace more long-term care. If students need more than a handful of sessions with a counselor, in my opinion, they should be looking outside of the campus structure to source it. I'm not unsympathetic to the issue and I think it is an important issue that needs focus but colleges are in the education business not the mental health business. We should look to our health care structure and ask what can be done to improve and increase resources for those needing mental health services.

Philly has some of the best medical care in the world, I am sure the mental health care is probably top notch too.\nWhat I have noticed as a parent at Penn trying to navigate the system -sign up, pay for things, etc is that the computer website system is archaic and disjointed.

I'm not a psychologist or psychiatrist but I'm a link in the chain of resources. As @doschicos said, if a student is experiencing depression or anxiety, the school counseling center is not the answer nor is the family doc. This requires special treatment that is beyond a licensed clinical counselor in most cases. Increasingly I think stressful situations amplify existing depression/anxiety, not cause it.\nThere are two pressure cookers being discussed here, admissions and success in an elite college. The admissions pressure is not the fault of the Ivies or any other college. The internet, CC, Common App, and other similar factors have driven up applications to top schools. More applications equals more competition. Colleges don't arbitrarily drive up SAT requirements, supply and demand does.\nThis is a tangent but the biggest thing parents and posters can do is defeat the dream school premise. D1 applied to two Ivies, USC, and a mix of public/private with shots at merit. There were a couple she didn't favor but knew she would be fine at one of the two state schools in her list just as much as her number one choice. I was proud of her for that attitude and it's the one that helps manage stress in competitive situations.\nI think it was Money Ball (the book) that discussed the philosophy of the best hitters in baseball. When taking a group of equally talented hitters, the one who could shake off the strike out as \"the pitcher won that one\" was the hitter who would have the best average. The one who stepped up to the plate the next time fearing another strike out was likely to have a self fulfilling fear.\nBack to depression, I read recently that the mind is the final frontier more than space or the depths of the oceans. We are a long way from solving depression/anxiety but identifying it and treating it from a multitude of angles is key. That is counseling from the right professional, meds if necessary, and a change of environment if necessary.\nThere are no simple answers or easy targets to blame.

Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain\u2019s rational part. This is the part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Teens process information with the amygdala. This is the emotional part.\nIn teen\u2019s brains, the connections between the emotional part of the brain and the decision-making center are still developing\u2014and not necessarily at the same rate. That\u2019s why when teens experience overwhelming emotional input, they can\u2019t explain later what they were thinking.

I was wondering what my odds are of getting into Wharton so that I can add things to my CV if I need to make ends meet. My current CV looks something like this:\n1) I am Science student i.e I have the most rigorous coursework available in the national education system. My subjects are English, Physics, chemistry, maths and computer science.\n2) I have my own product in the market ; It is a question based journal.\n3) I have my own YouTube channel.\n4) I am the best chess player at school.\n5) I am also a part of the student government.\n6) Multi talented, I have a hack for everything, I can talk to anybody anytime.\n7) My high school has an acceptance of 9%.

Do you need any financial aid, or can you pay for four years of tuition + COL in full? Also, a predicted SAT score isn't much to go on. You could get 1400 not 1520.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is even after you graduate from Wharton, you will have a hard time working in the US. You will have one year of work eligibility on OPT, but the only option after that is the H-1B visa, which you only have a 30% chance of winning with an undergraduate degree. So there is a 70% chance you would not be able to stay in the U.S. for longer than one year after graduation.

Although my question was more towards knowing what my odds are at getting accepted to Wharton and not about my chances for an H-1B visa yet I would like to bring to light that 93% of the undergraduates from Wharton are placed and then rest (most of them) go on to pursue higher education. So the point of not getting a job is almost negated.\nHowever, I would like you to chance me for Wharton with the specs that I mentioned earlier along with the added information in this reply and if there are somethings that I need to add to my application then your suggestions will really help me out.\nThanks in advance.

If you're curious about my stats, I would say that my overall portfolio would put me in decent stead to try for the ivy leagues but they will definitely still be \"reaches\" for me, especially considering the fact that I am an international student.\nI intend to study major in Economics at university and hopefully go into finance/banking if possible. I recognize that in accordance with that Wharton should be the dream school. However, I really love New York City and going to Columbia would help me to taste a wider variety of subjects.\nMy questions are:\n1) Which schools have lower admission rates for ED (i.e. which is harder to get into)? Although the ED rates for UPenn and Columbia are available online, they do not specify the admission rate of Wharton specifically. Could anyone comment on this please (I'm not from the US so I don't have sufficient knowledge/exposure to infer).\nHowever: I'm assuming Wharton should be HYSPM-level hard to get into, making it harder to ED into than Columbia?\n2) Does Wharton really give you a lot more opportunities banking/finance wise than Columbia?\nThanks so much!

There isn't really evidence to say either is \"better\" as both place their students into the positions that they want to go. Wharton has more students who want to go into business than CAS Econ.

Or if it's a healthcare startup, maybe they'd prefer a nursing student who has taken some marketing courses in Wharton and some creative writing courses in the College.

I made a visit to UPenn a month ago and talked to them about my situation, and they said that I could get a ton of money in grants if I get in. Well, lets just say I'm only applying to save my parents money and ease their consciences. I am a very DEmotivated student (depression, anxiety, multiple suicide attempts, etc) who is not involved in almost anything in school, and I pretty much accept it. I'm still trying to get into UPenn to make them happy. I have an average ACT (32 comp, 32 English, 29 math, 33 reading, 35 science) but a pretty good act writing score (12 comp, 12, 11, 11, 12). I have a couple extracurriculars, but not much. I'm in the top 4% in my class (my school is pretty competitive as many students get 36 comp acts every year). I know Penn is looking for motivated, positive, academically gifted, and influential students, of which I do not fit the description.\nI will apply and pay the $75 fee, but I know if I don't get in the bottleneck will be ACT comp, extracurriculars, and/or my pretty negative view on life.\nMany websites I've visited say that the ACT writing section carries little to no weight in admissions (to ease the minds of students who got less than what they expected) but since I did surprisingly well (I have no idea how), will that give me a better shot at admission?\nThank you guys for your input and I appreciate if you've read this far.

One is an internship. I have been told that to Ivy's, internships show privilege or family connections. Is that true or will Wharton appreciate it since I want to study finance while there? Will they appreciate my other non-internship ECs?\n2. What are some typical questions asked in Penn interviews? I know the basic questions asked in most interview but did not know if Penn has questions unique to them.\n3. For kids applying to Wharton, what are the two or three most important aspects of the application? ECs? Test grades? Recommendations?\n4. Lastly, how much consideration is given to recommendations? Only asking because I know my AP Statistics teacher rec will be killer and I wasn't sure how much that would boost my application overall. My AP English teacher rec will be pretty great too because she's an amazing writer but not as good as Stats teacher. Counselor rec will probably be 7/10 because I don't have many opportunities to talk with my counselor as she is in charge of 500 kids at our school.\nThank you in advance!

All psychology majors are required to complete one semester of empirical research. Such first-hand experience is essential to a sound education in psychology. Students are offered two means of satisfying this requirement:\n(1.) They may complete a 300-level course, which is designed to provide research experience. These courses are rarely offered.\nOR\n(2.) They may complete an independent study (PSYC 399) doing empirical research. Such independent study courses are designated Psychology 399. (Psychology 299 is used for independent study projects involving only scholarly library research and does not satisfy the requirement). Individual research is especially appropriate for students planning to go on to graduate school in psychology. See the department website for more information about completing a 399 project.\nArrangements for independent study are made on an individual basis, at the initiative of the student, with a faculty supervisor from the Psychology Department.

ED schools definitely inflate their yields with ED, but they are also constrained by the fact that they have to attract top notch students who are willing to commit ED in order to maintain the competitiveness of the student body and thus their ranking. Some ED schools are better at getting top notch students to commit ED than others. Also it is never the case that ED yield is 100%. It is usually around 96%.\nThe jump in Dartmouth's yield has more to do with the restructuring of their common app questions, which gave them greater ability to tease out who is a really good fit for Dartmouth. They did not admit a significantly higher portion of their class ED this year compared to last year.\nLastly, in response to the article comments that Penn has a higher yield than Princeton, I would say it is not very meaningful to compare yield rates between the HYPSM group and the group of other elite ED schools. Princeton has SCEA and also the overwhelming majority of the cross admits it loses go to other HYPSM schools.The probability of a Harvard acceptance given that a student has also gotten into Princeton is higher than the probability of a Harvard acceptance given a Penn acceptance. In other words, a higher percentage of Princeton admits has the option of a Harvard or Stanford, compared to Penn pr other top ED schools.\nAlso it is not meaningful to even compare overall yields between elite ED schools, since they accept different percentages of the class ED. Comparing RD yields between ED elite schools however could yield some meaningful insights. Also if we ever got a chance to look at the stats of the ED applicants pools at each elite school, that would also be interesting. (of course that will never happen though haha...)\nI personally find the article rather simplistic in its assessment of the topic.

What I enjoyed, though, are the admissions counselors who are finally willing to call a duck a duck - with so many schools with similar yields, yield is no longer a reflection of school popularity, as schools just inflate yield.\nAlso, re the Dartmouth yield improvement, I actually think you could take the analysis a level deeper. You're correct that Dartmouth didn't use ED more heavily this year, but still enjoyed a 8% bump in yield. Yes, the restructured common app questions helped with that, BUT you could also consider a greater point: last year, Dartmouth hired Lee Coffin from Tufts, an admissions counselor famous for \"yield protection,\" and inflating yield.\nYou can read alumni analysis of the hire here: http://www.dartblog.com/data/2016/02/012469.php (\"Bringing Tufts Syndrome to Hanover, NH\")\nIt's important to note, then, that ED isn't the only way to inflate yield. I believe Mr. Coffin is familiar with other tricks, and I wouldn't be surprised if he has used them in his first year at Dartmouth, to bump up that yield.\nThis brings me to my larger point - that we're in an unfortunate era where schools are trying hard to look very similar to one another. Soon, we'll have 15-20 schools with sub 10% accept rates and 60%+ yields. Further, school rhetoric and practice is starting to blend together (all schools will grade inflate, all schools praise interdisciplinary options, and the comprehensive research U - even at a place like Dartmouth - is the model to be emulated). It's never been harder for applicants to distinguish between schools, and that's unfortunate. Top schools are trying ever harder to be all things to all people - in an attempt to get as many to apply as possible.

HOWEVER- it leads to a more playful back and forth between wharton and non-wharton students than actual tension because you can just ask your wharton friends to book you the room if you REALLY want it and there are rooms all across campus that all students can book for the same purposes. The policy also makes sense because most students don't need to book those rooms but the Wharton MBA students REALLY need them and so if 10,000 undergrads were trying to book them every day, it would become really annoying. Despite the sensibility of the policy though, it remains a running joke. Outside of that, Penn students really are a cohesive bunch. I currently work with a handful of Wharton grads and I'm a CAS grad but we all graduated from Penn and share a common sense of community about it.

I graduated within the last 5 yrs and imo there isn't any rift or divide. Penn people hang out together regardless of the school they are in and there are no tensions. Everyone has access to the same academic, research & recruiting resources as well as classes. Also student clubs are open to everyone regardless of what school they are in. It is not uncommon for CAS and SEAS students for example to have leadership positions in Wharton clubs and vice versa. There is a sense of cohesiveness within the Penn community. The administration has worked very hard on that for the last 2-3 decades and they have definitely succeeded imo.\nDuring my time at Penn, I also didn't notice any sense of superiority coming from Wharton students over the rest of Penn students, and no resentment coming from the rest of Penn students towards Wharton (apart from the occasional playful Slytherin joke at whartons expense). As a dual degree student in SEAS and Wharton, i got to experience both sides so i m pretty confident in my assessment. Of course it is true that Wharton admits practically never turn down Penn for any non-HYPSM school, whereas there is a decent number of people admitted to the rest of Penn who turn it down for other elite schools apart from just HYPSM ( places like Columbia, Brown, Duke, Chicago etc). Also it is true that Wharton is slightly harder to get in, but the difference is small (think of the difference between Harvard/Stanford vs Yale/Princeton for example). When it comes to this level of colleges, these differences do not translate into a meaningful difference in student quality that could lead to start divides and tensions (such as Stern vs rest of NYU for example).\nThe only real divide in my opinion was when it came to Wharton facilities, and specifically Huntsman, While any Penn undergrad can enter Huntsman and study there, non-wharton kids can only log into huntsman computers if they are taking a Wharton class during that semester, and even then they cannot book a group study room. On the other hand Wharton kids have access to computers in the engineering quad and any other buildings. You have to keep in mind however that huntsman serves also the MBAs so if the administration made everything open to all undergrads, the demand would be insane. This is because Huntsman is both very fancy-looking (most elite business school buildings tend to be..) and also at a very prime location on campus. However, I feel this issue will be solved with the construction of the fancy new Economics/Political science building at Penn, which will be very close to Huntsman.

Penn Anthropology is probably the finest department at Penn - and this includes the standing of Wharton, Med, etc. BUT, only about 1.2% of students major in this subject, compared to 3.75% of Princeton's class.\nInterestingly, economics, which is a very good but not top 5 department at Penn sees nearly as much interest as economics at Princeton (which is probably one of Princeton's finest departments).\nAt Princeton, about 125 students per year major in econ - so 125/980 = 12.7% of the class.\nAt Penn, about 180 students per year major in econ - so 180/1600 = 11.2% of the class\nSo the numbers actually aren't too similar - some of Princeton's departments get 2X or 3X the interest in comparison to UPenn.\n(And note, I'm actually underestimating Penn's universe of eligible students, as it's possible someone from Wharton or Engineering looked to double major with a BA/BS in history or anthro or something. So the real target number of potential candidates at Penn is probably closer to 1800-1900, NOT the 1600 I mention.

By my quick review, the largest major in the College is Economics with 141 majors. I'm not sure how \"bankable\" Econ is, but I have no doubt that it's one of the most popular majors at most top schools, as you pointed out with Princeton. Beyond that, I think it's inaccurate to characterize the next most popular majors in the College as \"bankable,\" or as more popular at Penn's College than at most other liberal arts schools. Also, your analysis fails to take into account the popularity of interdisciplinary majors in the College, which by definition touch on several traditional liberal arts disciplines. Again, based on quick review, I found the most popular majors in the College based on the Class of 2016 Career Plans Survey Report to be the following, with number of majors in parentheses:\nEcon (141)\nBiology (111)\nBiological Basis of Behavior (108)\nPolitical Science (91)\nPsychology (62)\nEnglish (58)\nHealth and Societies (58)\nCommunications (57)\nPhilosophy, Politics, and Economics (55)\nInternational Relations (54)\nHistory (47)\nBiochemistry (33)\nCognitive Science (32)\nMath (26)\nComputer Science (22)\nThose majors account for 955 of the Class of 2016 respondents, and if we extrapolate from the 79% response rate, we can assume that about 1,210 out of the 1,600 members of the Class of 2016--or about 75% of the class--majored in those 15 areas. And again, taking into account that the popular interdisciplinary majors--BBB, Health and Societies, Communications, PPE, IR, and Cog Sci--span several traditional liberal arts departments such as biology, psychology, history, political science, philosophy, economics, sociology, anthropology, math, etc., I'm fairly confident that you'd find that similar proportions of liberal arts undergrads at other top schools tend to major in those and similar fields. Sure, one can point to individual examples of, e.g., 30 Anthro majors at Princeton vs. 20 at Penn, but I suspect that at most comparable schools--other Ivies, Duke, Stanford, Northwestern, and some school on the south side of Chicago whose name I forget --you'd find a similar mix of majors (and component majors in the case of Penn's interdisciplinary majors) among the most popular majors chosen by 75% of the liberal arts students.

What differentiates Penn (and, similarly, Northwestern and Cornell) is it's one of the only top schools with many undergrad divisions, all mixing and mingling together. You'll never find as high a concentration of history majors at Penn than Princeton because UPenn has 4 undergrad schools, and Princeton has 2 (the liberal arts college and engineering).\nNow, some schools may be more STEM focused (like Stanford) or more Humanities heavy (like Yale), but Penn, Northwestern, and Cornell are somewhat distinct from the other (non-technical institute) schools because they have more undergrad schools. It changes the complexion of these schools, and makes comparing, say, UPenn and Princeton, or Dartmouth and Cornell, a limited exercise.\nIt's why, when deciding whether to study undergrad history at Penn, a paramount consideration is the structure of its undergrad program - in a way that's different than deciding to study history at, say, Yale or Princeton or Columbia or that school on the south side of Chicago that I criticize often on another board (all these other schools have fairly similar undergrad structures).

In fact, a Wharton student cannot even major in ECONOMICS, despite the name of the Wharton undergraduate degree (BS in Economics). Wharton undergrads USED to be able to major in Economics when that department was actually housed within the Wharton School (as were Political Science and Sociology, believe it or not), but those departments were moved from Wharton to what was then the Faculty of Arts and Sciences--now the School of Arts and Sciences--more than 40 years ago. And the ability of Wharton undergrads to major in Economics subsequently disappeared. In fact, Wharton undergrads don't MAJOR in anything at all at this point, but rather have \"concentrations\" in Wharton departments (Management, Finance, etc.) that require significantly fewer courses than do \"majors\" in the College (typically only 4 courses required for a Wharton concentration, if memory serves, compared to the 8-10 or so required for a major in the College). So the only valid Penn undergrad population for comparison of numbers of liberal arts majors to those in undergrad liberal arts populations at other schools, is the 6400 undergrads in the College of Arts and Sciences.

First, only 30% of Wharton undergrads pursue dual degree programs, and that includes the coordinated dual degree programs with all 3 of the other undergrad schools--CAS, SEAS, and Nursing. So at most, there may be 200 or so Wharton undergrads pursuing uncoordinated dual degrees at any given time and, of course, only a portion of those are with CAS. Which means we're probably talking about 100-200 Wharton undergrads pursuing uncoordinated dual degrees with CAS. Given that there are 6300-6400 undergrads in CAS, that additional 100-200 Wharton uncoordinated dual degree students is really negligible for purposes of this discussion. And even if we include them, for purposes of their liberal arts majors, they're essentially CAS students since they must complete the entire CAS curriculum to earn a BA. So it's not as if the 1800 or so Wharton undergrads, and for that matter the 600 Nursing undergrads and 1700 SEAS undergrads, all have the option of pursuing a liberal arts major such as History. Only the 6300-6400 CAS students have the option of pursuing a liberal arts major, plus perhaps a couple of hundred dual degree students from the other undergrad schools who, as I said, are essentially CAS students for the purposes of pursing their liberal arts majors and degrees. So again, when we analyze the relative popularity of various liberal arts majors at Penn, we're looking at a population of about 6500 undergrads who can and do choose from among those majors, just as similar numbers of students at Brown, Harvard, Duke, etc. choose from those and similar majors. And to compare the popularity of certain liberal arts majors at Penn with their popularity at other schools, it's only the 6500 liberal arts students at Penn who are relevant.

At Princeton, maybe 8% of the population studies history avidly, but you don't have such breath in applied and pre professional studies.\nSimply saying the percentages are similar between upenn and other top schools does a disservice to the atmosphere/environment at UPenn, and doesn't accurately portray what being a liberal arts major is at this school, at least from what I remember of my interactions with students there, although this was a while back.

Yes, at many of the other top schools a liberal arts major can't supplement his curriculum with a course or two in Wharton, Nursing, or the Law School, and he may not have Wharton, Engineering, or Nursing students in some of his introductory classes, but a Penn liberal arts major will still be taking a good number of more advanced courses in his major field that are populated almost exclusively by fellow majors or majors in related fields. And in the case of the more popular liberal arts majors, he'll be in a fairly large group of fellow majors in the Junior and Senior classes (anywhere from about 40 to about 280 students in the 15 most popular majors using the numbers in post #11), and have a selection of a significant number and variety of faculty and courses in his major.

And just as he may have some Wharton, Engineering, or Nursing students in some of his more general or introductory classes, so too will an English or History major at Brown, Harvard, or Princeton have Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, or Math majors--many of whom are pre-med, pre-law, pre-MBA, or even, especially in the case of Wall Street feeders like Harvard and Princeton, pre-investment banking or management consulting--in his introductory or more general classes.\nThe academic experience is just not that much different for one of the 200 or so Biology or Political Science majors, or the 100 or so English or History majors, who are in Penn's College at any given time. And the economic realities and employment prospects of life beyond their current undergraduate liberal arts curriculum are just as pressing and influential for English and History majors at Harvard, Princeton, Brown, Duke, etc. as they are for English and History majors at Penn, irrespective of whether they have Bio, Physics, Math, Econ, Engineering, or even Finance and Nursing majors in their introductory classes and extra-curricular and social activities. At least that's been my experience based on my own and my friends' and classmates' time at Penn, as well as that of my child and her friends and classmates.\nI think the bottom line is that each top school has its own unique atmosphere and \"vibe,\" although all of these schools are large, diverse, and complex enough to provide a wide variety of undergraduate experiences. And certainly the atmosphere at Penn is colored by the presence of Wharton and Nursing and Engineering, and the additional extra-curricular activities and on-campus recruiting that those schools bring. But an English, History, Biology or Sociology major at Penn--or even an Anthropology, Music, Art History, or Cinema Studies major at Penn--can submerse herself in a rich environment of numerous and diverse faculty, classes, research opportunities, extracurriculars, and graduate school, internship, and career opportunities, all in or related to her liberal arts major, and be surrounded by tens if not hundreds of fellow majors doing the same. Just as vigorously as she could at Harvard, Brown, Princeton, or Duke. And many Penn liberal arts majors do just that.

If anything, I've been complimentary of Penn's history dep't and the experience it offers - I don't mean to imply that the experience is any less rich or varied or vigorous than what's found at other top schools- it's just different. Further, within the narrow confines of the dep't itself and classes offered, I think the academic experience is similar at virtually ALL of the top 20 or so schools - from Harvard and Yale to UPenn and Emory and Wash U. At any of these schools, you'll get a fairly bright subset of students passionate about history, who all tend to take similar upper-level courses together.\nWhat happens in the classroom in the upper-level courses, I've found, is actually just a small piece of what it means to major in a humanities field, and you are underselling the varied academic experience - related to their chosen field of study - most Penn history majors have by virtue of being part of a variegated undergrad. If the experience you and your child had as humanities majors at Penn mirrored the experience at Harvard or Duke, well, I'm sorry to say, you/yours didn't maximize the experiential offerings present within this major at UPenn - it's supposed to feel different - by structure and by design.\nYes, the narrow subset of upper-level classes taken for the major will be similar to what's found at Harvard or Duke or Wash U, but at Penn the general experience in the major (at least from what I saw) is quite different. First, the faculty tend to be a more interdisciplinary, with joint appointments elsewhere (as I noted above). Second, in symposia that undergrads attend, and even in some of the higher-level classes, it's more likely that those from vastly different fields (business, engineering, nursing, etc.) will attend and will engage in dialogue about the academic subject. Third, having pre-professional students in nursing or wharton is quite different than having a potential econ major/future i-banker in your intro US history class. They're being trained differently, there's more of an emphasis (especially in nursing) on the practical/clinical, and there's more defined interest from a younger age. You're mixing liberal arts students with literally pre-professional students from freshman year, and that's a hallmark distinguishing factor for UPenn. Fourth, there's broad departmental emphasis on interdisciplinary study - so history professors actively look to collaborate with those in other fields, and students will be exposed to that.\nWith the above in mind, why would Harvard, Duke, etc. be good comparators? The ethos' of the schools are different and, even more than that, the literal components of the undergrad system are different. Yes, in a minor set of classes the experience will be similar, but the broad experience of history majors is - and should - be nigh incomparable.\nWhen deciding between Penn or Duke or Emory, the threshold question is different - at Penn students have to be willing to immerse themselves in a school devoted to interdisciplinary study. Yes, you could block it all out and have an experience in the history dept that is similar to what's found at Duke or Emory, but why would you want to do that? The school makes it hard TO block this experience out, and you're blocking out exactly what makes UPenn distinctive. Otherwise, you could go to one of another 15-20 places that are basically just as good for history.

But to the extent there is still a difference in our views, it's that while I agree that Penn offers a broader experience than its peers in terms of the classes and fellow students available to liberal arts students in the College, it ALSO offers a more traditional liberal arts curriculum and experience to those undergrads who seek it, and a substantial portion of the students in the College pursue just that. And while interdisciplinary studies are truly a hallmark of Penn, that interdisciplinary aspect can simply include the combination and intersection of 2 or 3 traditional liberal arts fields (e.g., the quite popular interdisciplinary majors of Biological Basis of Behavior; Health and Societies; Philosophy, Politics, and Economics; and International Relations), and doesn't necessarily involve the more professional undergraduate schools.\nPlus, many if not most of the liberal arts departments in the College each have their own comprehensive and diverse faculties and class offerings WITHOUT the need to rely on professors or classes from other departments. As I said, a major in most of the liberal arts departments in the College COULD rely solely upon the faculty and courses in those departments to complete the major, with a focus on any number of specialties within those majors. And many undergrads in the College do just that. But as you point out, the interdisciplinary opportunities are also there to a degree not matched at most of Penn's peers.\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that both types of liberal arts study--interdisciplinary AND a more traditional and compartmentalized approach--are readily available in the College. In other words, the interdisciplinary opportunities at Penn are ADDITIVE to the more traditional liberal arts experience available at Penn, and do not supplant it. Both types of liberal arts experience and curriculum are readily available and pursued by undergrads in the College.\nAnd to assuage your concerns about my and my child's undergraduate experiences at Penn, I was a Wharton student who actually majored in the liberal arts field of Economics (when Wharton undergrads could still do that) and took several classes each in Political Science, Sociology, History, History and Sociology of Science, and even Music! :-) And my daughter was, as I said, a Humanities major, who also took a couple of classes in the Nursing School and Wharton.

And yes, I think we're mostly in agreement.\nHOWEVER - while it is possible for CAS students to have a \"traditional and compartmentalized\" approach, doesn't that cut against Penn's ethos? Yes, this is possible, but the school's entire push - it's entire identity, really - is to cut across fields of study - to cut across theory and practicality. You could go to UPenn, dive into the philosophy major, only interact with the Philo club, and have an experience that resembles what you'd find at Swarthmore or St. Johns College. Or, you could dive into subject matter at Wharton, avoid interaction with CAS nursing etc., and have an experience that resembles NYU Stern. But isn't that the wrong approach?\nBut isn't pursuing the \"traditional and compartmentalized\" approach in direct contravention to the spirit of the Penn experience? Aren't you then missing out on the Penn experience, and trying to make it an experience that is more readily found elsewhere (by structure and design)?\nIt may be possible - but it still leads to extremely poor comparisons, and seems suboptimal. Indeed, it seems to endorse going to a school while being in opposition to the dominant pedagogical approach of the school. There's dissonance in that, no?

Yes, interdisciplinary opportunities abound at Penn, to a degree not found anywhere else. But it is not REQUIRED--by rule, ethos, peer pressure, or otherwise--that the 6400 or so undergrads in the College all pursue an interdisciplinary education, and MANY do not. Interdisciplinary education at Penn is an available opportunity, not a REQUIREMENT. And even if an undergrad in the College takes advantage of an interdisciplinary opportunity or two--a course or two in the Law School, Wharton, or Nursing, for example--it doesn't mean that interdisciplinary study dominates their curriculum or time at Penn, especially given that undergrads in the College take anywhere from 32 to 36 or more courses to complete their degrees.\nAnd again, trust me on this, many if not most undergrads in the College do not engage in interdisciplinary study beyond maybe a class or two outside of the College, if even that much. Even the highly popular interdisciplinary majors in the College--BBB, PP&E, IR, etc.--are mostly, if not completely, centered in traditional liberal arts departments. So why would an undergrad who wants a traditional liberal arts education want to attend Penn? Because its traditional liberal arts programs and departments are among the best in the country, comparable to those at its peers. As I've indicated before, several of the departments in the College are regularly ranked among the top 10 in the country, and several more are ranked among the top 20. And the liberal arts departments in the College are well-equipped to support a strong traditional liberal arts education and major. For example:\n1. Penn's Anthropology Department currently lists 16 full-time professors on its standing faculty; offers an undergraduate major that requires 14 classes, up to 3 of which can be non-Antrho classes, meaning that 11-14 classes will be ONLY in the Antrho Dept.; and offers 5 specialized tracks within the major, including General Anthropology, Archaeological Anthropology, Biological Anthropology, Cultural and Linguistic Anthropology, or Medical Anthropology and Global Health.\n2. Penn's English Department currently lists 38 full-time professors on its standing faculty; offers an undergraduate major that requires 13 classes, most or all of which are in the English Department; and offers NINETEEN (19) possible concentrations within the major in addition to the standard major, including Africana Literature and Cultures, Celtic Literature and Cultures, Creative Writing, Early Literature to 1660, Law and Literature, Literary Theory and Cultural Studies, Medieval/Renaissance, The Novel, and Poetry and Poetics.\n3. Penn's History Department currently lists 34 full-time professors on its standing faculty; offers an undergraduate major that requires 12 classes, at least 8 or which must be in the History Department, meaning that 8-12 classes will be ONLY in the History Department; and offers up to 8 possible concentrations in addition to the standard major, including American History, European History, World History, Diplomatic History, Economic History, Gender History, Intellectual History, and Jewish History.\n4. Penn's Political Science Department currently lists 38 full-time professors on its standing faculty; offers an undergraduate major that requires 12 classes, at least 9 of which must be in the Political Science Department, meaning that 9-12 classes will be ONLY in the Political Science Department; and offers up to 5 possible concentrations in addition to the standard major, including American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Political Theory, and Political Economy.\n5. Even Penn's Art History Department currently lists 11 full-time professors on its standing faculty (with an additional 5 cross-listed with other departments); and offers an undergraduate major that requires 13 classes, at least 10 of which must be in the Art History Department, meaning that 10-13 classes will be ONLY in the Art History Department.\nSo you can see, @Cue7, using these 5 departments as examples, the bulk of the classes in a major in the College are taken in THAT DEPARTMENT, let alone in the College of Arts and Sciences. And it's very possible that ALL of the classes for a major will be taken in that department. Needless to say, the liberal arts departments in the College are generally quite self-sufficient and free-standing, as are the majors they offer.\nSo why would a \"traditional\" liberal arts student choose Penn over, say, Brown, Duke, or even Chicago, even if he doesn't plan to take any classes outside of the College or pursue an interdisciplinary major? Because the undergraduate liberal arts program and departments at Penn, by themselves, are generally comparable to those at Penn's peers. And given that parity, a liberal arts student might simply prefer the campus, location, social life, exposure to non-liberal arts students, and general feel and fit of Penn to any of its peers.\nPenn's robust interdisciplinary offerings and opportunities are merely the icing on the cake should a liberal arts undergrad want to take advantage of them. But for many undergrads in the College, the cake, alone, is more than enough.

It's an available opportunity - but not a requirement. You could go to Duke for four years, never go to a game, and have an experience that resembles Swarthmore undergrad or St. John's College. You could probably surround yourself with other people who never go to a game, and ignore this completely - so that you have a little Swarthmore bubble in the middle of Durham. You could do this because you selected Duke because you like Durham and Duke has a great Poli Sci dep't.\nTo do so, however, cuts against the grain of the school's identity - and its ethos. From their president down (and incoming Duke president Vincent Price - of UPenn fame) has stated the importance of basketball to Duke. It's in their capital campaign slogans. It's discussed by senior administrators and prospective students alike. It forms a key part of the experience. Ignore it, but at your own fault - you might as well have gone to Swarthmore or Reed or Emory. I'd wager a good majority of students attend Duke with this feature as a centerpiece of their consideration.\nSame line of reasoning goes for Penn's liberal arts majors. You could have an experience that resembles what you'd find at Brown or Dartmouth or Yale - it's certainly not a requirement that you dive into the interdisciplinary waters. From UPenn President Amy Gutmann on down, however, this cuts against Penn's ethos. It's in the capital campaign slogans. It's in the air. It's in the very structure of the school - notwithstanding the 7-10 classes you might take (out of a total of 40-50) that don't feature such interdisciplinary approaches. It's the defining feature of the experience. You might as well have gone to Brown or Dartmouth or Yale, otherwise.\nSo, I'm not sure why your view here on this is myopic. Yes, it's not required, and you can make UPenn's liberal arts college feel like any other top 20 liberal arts college. You could do the same at most other top places, too.\nBut Penn chooses to have students from all its undergrad schools living together, and collaborating together. Of the, say, 12 required history classes - maybe only 6-8 of them will just have an undiluted pool of serious history folks. The rest will feature the broad panoply of Penn - a panoply you can't get elsewhere, and the reason the majority of students choose UPenn.\nIt puzzles me when people say you can get a liberal arts education at Penn or Cornell that mirrors what you'd get at Dartmouth or Yale. Such a view limits and winnows out the true richness of the UPenn undergrad experience. If you truly wanted such a setup - have segregated student housing (e.g. dorms for CAS, dorms for Wharton, etc.), and don't allow cross-registration at school symposia, speaker series, etc. Only then would the CAS experience resemble what you get elsewhere. Once you allow intermixing to occur - from intro level classes onward, the experience differs from what you get elsewhere.\nAnd that's exactly the point.\n(I wonder, btw, what President Gutmann or incoming Provost Pritchett would think of the phrase \"Penn's robust interdisciplinary offerings are merely icing on the cake should a liberal arts undergrad want to take adv. of them.\" This is hardly icing to the Penn experience - it's germane to the school's mission, from the undergrad environment forward. If students don't take advantage of this, just like if Duke students don't go to basketball games - it's often their loss. They aren't required to, sure, but... really?)

Mixed enrollment is often the case in many of the lower-level survey courses, in particular. But the degree to which it occurs in upper level courses really varies by field.\nI was a physics major, and my fellow undergrad students in my upper level physics and math courses were all CAS students. Or at least everyone I know about was. At the lower level, the \"higher\" track physics & math courses intended for majors were also all CAS students. Another, \"lower\" track was for engineering students, but there was a different, analogous course to that for CAS students.. Though that one probably also had some enrollment from some of the other colleges..\nSome other majors will have mixed enrollment all the way through , particularly Biology. And there will be everything in between.\nIt is true that everyone mixes in the dorms, and socially in general.\nAnd the CAS courses a Physics major may use to fill distribution requirements may have some non-CAS students in them. But the extent of that depends on the specific courses one selects.\nit doesn't really matter much though. Students in the other colleges do not want to get bad grades either.

Anyway, as the *only* actual Penn history major currently posting on this thread, I'm happy to report that @45 Percenter is, still, the authority on Penn undergrad experience on CC. His post in #23 is spot on. Yes, Penn's undergraduate experience can be incomparably interdisciplinary but it doesn't have to be. Additionally, the way you engage with the interdisciplinary opportunities at Penn can differ from your peers. But none of that is that relevant to your actual questions! SO let's get to those now:\n1) What's the daily/weekly workload like?\nThe daily workload is heavy but manageable. Usually you will be assigned weekly readings which you are expected to complete in their entirety- though you can get away with skimming some parts in preparation for larger lectures (but you'll have to be ready for class discussion in seminars and recitations that are paired with large lectures). Some classes have you write frequent reflection papers on your readings. Others will save most of your writing for your midterm and final exam. I usually spent approximately 3-5 hours per night on my history course work and much more time on the weekends. That still left me time to have several majors/minors and to be very, very involved in campus life. And yes, I slept 6-8 hours per night, ate three meals a day and found time to exercise and see friends (though many of my friends were in my extracurriculars with me).\n2) What's the typical classroom atmosphere?\nThe classroom experience will vary depending on the type of class. Large lectures with someone like Professor Childers felt like story time during which this fixture of the Penn History Department tells you the story of World War II in the most engaging, thorough and incredible way. You then break down those stories in recitation which is usually characterized by a lively debate among you, your peers, and an upper level grad student who leads the conversation.\nBy contrast, in small classes and seminars (which comprise the majority of the classes you'll take as a history major) it's all about the students in the class pushing the conversation forward with their interpretations of the readings. There are *often* very respectful disagreements as you're going to be surrounded by some of the smartest kids in your generation debating some of the biggest questions in the history of the world. Put simply, it's a history fan's dream! I DEEPLY miss the incredible conversations with amazing professors like Mary Frances Berry and Thomas Sugrue (who has unfortunately left Penn for a bigger salary and a free, luxury apartment in NYC) at the head of my 12 person seminars, You don't often find those incredible conversations in most of the professional world if you aren't involved in academia in some way.\n3) What are some Study Abroad opportunities?\nThere are SO many study abroad opportunities. Pretty much every program available to penn students is open to history majors because our requirements are relatively flexible. You can often complete most of your required classes at Penn if you don't want to take any history courses abroad or you can probably apply certain classes from your program to your major depending on Penn's policies. Be sure to check out their website about studying abroad. I trust you'll have a wonderful experience no matter where you go!\n4) Is History a very time-consuming major compared to like English or Psych?\nI majored in both History and English and I found that my history major was less time consuming than my English major because in English we were often expected to read entire novels each week and write frequent essays in preparation for discussion while in history we often read excerpts of books and more easily digestible textbook materials (as compared to the somewhat impenetrable prose of certain Russian and French novelists...  ).\n5) What are the research opportunities like?\nResearch opportunities abound. Check out CURF (the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships) as well as the various projects in which your professors are involved. Because Penn is one of the world's finest *research* universities, you can be sure that each of your professors is producing groundbreaking scholarship on any range of subjects. Pick the professor doing the research you like most and ask if you can be involved-- i guarantee they will say yes (because they need the help) or they will point you in the direction of another opportunity to do similar work. And don't forget grad students who need your help too! Penn grad students are the ivy league history professors of tomorrow! Building connections with them and helping them in their research can be very fulfilling as well. Finally, if you have your own research interests, pursue them!! You can request a faculty advisor or just take advantage of Penn's amazing resources (like the Kislak center and access to Library Company of Philadelphia - America\u2019s first successful lending library and oldest cultural institution according to their website).\n6) Does Penn offer an interesting variety of classes?\nTHERE ARE SO MANY INTERESTING CLASSES. The variety of classes makes it nearly impossible to choose which ones you want to pursue because they all sound so amazing. I never had trouble filling up my schedule; the challenge was not over enrolling!\nA final note on interdisciplinary study at Penn- Yes, Penn has some of the most amazing interdisciplinary opportunities and it has done more than most other universities to make those opportunities available to ALL undergrads no matter their school, area of study, etc. etc. And I do whole-heartedly believe that I was made a better student by being surrounded by people studying in so many different disciplines all living together and taking classes together because their different training led to very different approaches to the subject material. That being said, the majority of your experience as a history major will be strikingly similar to those experiences at the other ivies. The reality is that i read all the same books as the english majors at Brown and Yale and we all came out pretty well educated. Did I enjoy my experience because of the added interdisciplinary opportunities, access to a perfectly sized/beautiful/major urban metropolis, and life on a gorgeous/contiguous/300 acre campus? You bet I did! But those are 'experiential' factors that don't really speak to the quality of education you will receive at these schools. I chose Penn over (primarily) Yale and Columbia because I knew I could get the same rigorous education as my peers in NYC and New Haven with the added benefit of Penn's interdisciplinary opportunities and campus experience in a city. When thinking about Penn and its peers, the key is to focus on fit because the academic experience will be enriching in different ways among all of them!

A final note on interdisciplinary study at Penn from an actual undergrad alum:\nA Penn education is about choice! You can go through Penn and have the most interdisciplinary experience available in higher education or you can avoid the multitude of classes, extracurriculars, research centers, assignments, lectures, speakers, professors, etc., as best you can if it's not your cup of tea. I agree that Penn has done an EXCEPTIONAL job embedding the interdisciplinary experience in its DNA. But it's also a testament to the strength and variety of a Penn education that one's individual experience does not have to be *characterized* by it if one chooses to avoid it. Something can be true of the whole university that is not true of its individual component parts: Penn offers an incomparably interdisciplinary education but it does not lack for individual, traditional disciplinary depth in each of its offerings, all of which its students are permitted to enjoy in the best way they see fit. In fact, that traditional disciplinary depth is what allows those seeking interdisciplinary offerings to get the amazing education they seek without sacrificing the quality of the programs that captured their primary interests.\nI know one english major who fulfilled her requirements, completed the major, lived only with other english majors after freshman year, and was involved in english tutoring in West Philadelphia and other English-focused opportunities through the Kelly Writers House and the creative writing professors. Her experience wasn't devoid of interdisciplinary components (as no education even at a school like Princeton or Columbia in 2017 could possibly be totally devoid of interdisciplinary components) but it was far less interdisciplinary than my education which included classes in the graduate/professional schools, classes specifically designed from an interdisciplinary perspective, classes with professors who hold appointments across schools, research that cut across departments, and living with and taking classes with friends from across the University. And yet, the strength of Penn's individual departmental education carried her to one of the top English PhD programs in the country where she continues to thrive.\nCharacterizing it as just \"a value add\" completely misses the point! Penn is nearly incomparably interdisciplinary and students love to take advantage of that in the ways THEY want. The beauty of a Penn education is that you can make of it what you want. So if you just want to come to Penn because its English department is truly one of the best in the entire world but you don't care about the interdisciplinary nature of the University or department as a whole, then you absolutely should matriculate because you'll get an amazing, rigorous, in-depth education in the discipline of your choosing at a school you like for reasons outside of its interdisciplinary strength!

For life sciences, Penn has quite stronger departments and research opportunities through its top medical school & hospital. They are both right on campus and have plenty of research opportunities easily accessible by undergrads. When it comes to English Penn has also consistently been considered stronger but the practical differences at the undergrad level shouldn't be major. You also should take a look at the Kelly Writers House at Penn http://www.writing.upenn.edu/wh/. If you are recruited it will boost your chances at Penn and is also an amazing community/resource for all writers and english majors at Penn.\nGiven that you seem to like both schools equally, I would say that it is fair to factor into your decision the relative strength of the schools in your area of interest.\nHowever, if you prefer Brown more, I would advise you to go with that. Both are excellent schools, and at this level fit matters more than academic strength differences when it comes to undergrad.

This is completely anecdotal but there was a guy in one of the student clubs I was involved in at Penn who had transferred from Columbia and he used to say that Penn had by far the bigger, more vibrant social scene. ( I graduated within the last 5 yrs so the account is pretty recent). Also at Penn the social life is mainly organized though student clubs and organizations which are the main outlets for students to find their friend groups on campus.\nI feel Penn has a major campus social scene that is supplemented by what Philly has to offer. Philly is big enough amd offer a lot of social outlets but is not overwhelmingly big. On the other hand New York is amazing and impressive and offers way more things to do than Philly, but it is overwhelmingly big and some feel it dilutes the undergrad campus life at Columbia. Again this is just the opinion of people I know and also my opinion. ( and a big reason I chose Penn over Columbia). I am sure there are other people who have liked the social life at Columbia a lot and really wanted to be in NYC for college.\nOne thing is for sure though, overall Penn people are probably more social, the \"social Ivy\" tag of Penn is very well deserved Imo.\nOutside of social life, another thing to consider is the core. Columbia has a core while Penn does not. Some people love the core, others prefer a more flexible curriculum. If you want to do a dual degree, double major, minor etc a flexible curriculum makes it quite easier.\nObviously I am a bit biased between the two, but hopefully this is kinda helpful.
