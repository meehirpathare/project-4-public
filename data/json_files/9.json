Wharton's applied economics will fit your need. But mathematical economics is a totally or completely totally different track.

This tack is basically an Econ degree with heavy dosage on mathematical analysis. Add some ingredients of statistics courses from Wharton then you will be home free. It practically prepares for everything required in all high level analysis programs including computational analysis, engineering and economic analysis etc.\nMany other top Econ programs are geared up on this trend, yearly competitions are on going in this field on national level. I heard Penn's participants are doing impressively but for the most updated result you have to double check yourself. NYU has Courant institute of math and well known to be a math temple, so their Econ and math program should be also good. But how that compares to Penn, then you have to decide yourself. ( note: brown also has a similar program but in applied math, mit just opened a joint degree in econ/math and Econ /compsci, but then their institutional requirements in all science subjects for all students are extra work and risky.

I am so sure when you submitted your early application to Stanford at that moment that you had no doubt you would go to Stanford.\nThe question is if you really like Stanford that much then why would you ask about Penn m&t program? That comes down to the fact that you must found something very solidly interesting about this program that you have started to have a second thought about your first choice. Don't worry, this is absolutely normal and common for today's college application processes. Penn M&T has been institutionalized for decades, graduates from this program are(were) very carefully screened and chosen. Prestigious firms responded to this form of penn training very favorably and would continue to recruite those graduates. Many experienced members in this forum had mentioned many times that it is not surprised to see M&T students turning down other top choices. In other words, all these kids are qualified to enroll in any top schools without hesitations.\nYour most important part of the question is what would you like to get from this M&T program that Stanford can not immediately provide you? Stanford has management science and engineering, Berkeley has MET, MIT has new program in econ and compsci joint degree, and Princeton, Columbia and Others have financial engineering. But none of these similar named programs can be compared with the long successful program of PENN's M&T. You major in penn's compsci or one major engineering field and at the same time in Wharton' famous applied Econ degree program, with all your friends surrounding with similar goals and levels. You must remember that before you enter that university, that is the name it will affect you, once you are actually in the university and that is the department it affects you most. Finally when you set foot on Stanford or M&T program, it will be the people in that particular program will affect you most. You still have time to decide, but one thing for sure there will not be one best choice or university for all students. Their need, interest, goal and talent come first. My best luck with you.

At M&T you are a big fish in an already very big pond. At Stanford the same person will be an above-average fish in probably the biggest or second-biggest pond there is. The level of individual attention, guidance and resources the M&T and other coordinated Penn dual degree kids get is simply unparalleled.

Penn M&T students have their own building, great advising, etc., but they are still part of the U. more broadly.

I don't yet concede the title of best research U to Stanford (that title still lies to the U in Cambridge MA, with their 300 years at the top counting for something), but the battle is getting very close indeed.\nIt'd be cool to be able to participate in that contest. The OP couldn't by coming to UPenn - either now or, most likely, in the future.\nA final point - M&T is wonderful, but it's a narrower track.

The question then becomes - is he actually being recruited or is he just having conversations with the coach. If he is recruited, the coach generally has a certain number of admissions slots for recruited athletes. In that case, he would receive a likely letter.\nI wonder though about his ability to do ROTC in addition to a Varsity sport. I don't have any concept of the commitment for ROTC but I do know the varsity athlete time commitment is big. He might want to discuss with the coach whether or not the two commitments could co-exist. Best of luck to your son.

You probably would get better answers there as well.\nIn a nutshell, if he is being recruited athletically he still needs good grades/scores, but not as good as he would otherwise. It varies by sport what is needed (football typically gets the most leeway, crew the least, the rest somewhere in-between). My S was given minimum numbers by the coach at Penn that he needed to hit. I would give you the number, but it's pretty meaningless because it will vary by sport. I'm guessing soccer is higher than average, just because you have lots of affluent soccer players who probably are scoring well. So they don't need to dip as low to field a competitive team.\nThe \"one standard deviation\" comment refers back to the academic index, which is an Ivy League thing. I won't explain it all here there is plenty of information out there. But I will say that is just an average that needs to be hit by all athletes at a school. And usually each coach will have his/her own number, which may be lower/higher than the overall number for the athletic department. By definition, some of the athletes will be above average, some below. And those below will generally be your better players. There will also be some floor that a coach has to meet for admissions to accept an athlete. S right now has an ACT that the coach at a different Ivy is fine with, but he said admissions is probably 50/50 on accepting him unless he can raise it a point.\nBottom line, just ask the coach what is needed. Everyone either S or I asked gave the information. Several led with it. Because if you know you can't get a ACT 30 (or whatever the minimum will be) then it is wasting everyone's time to continue the conversation. I would guess if you already have scores, your S is in the ballpark or the coach would have already ended the conversation.

I created a differentiation between some schools (like Penn and Cornell) - which tend to attract all-around \"maximizers\" and other schools (MIT, Swarthmore, etc.) which tend to draw students who focus more on a couple - rather than many - areas.\nNow, Stanford is certainly more on the \"all-around maximizer\" side of the spectrum. Also, while it doesn't have an \"exclusive\" on this, it's perhaps the most intense, high-flying example of this mindset. Yes, you see it at UPenn, Cornell, NU, etc., but Stanford is - for good or bad - the gold standard here.\nAlso, @Penn95 - I think it's too generous to say that Penn plays at a \"slightly lower level\" than Stanford here. In its embodiment of the \"all-around maximizer\" archetype, Stanford is miles ahead of virtually everywhere else. Looked at through almost any lens and on aggregate - e.g. most number of Intel Science Winners AND # of olympians, most rhodes scholars AND NFL players - whatever - there isn't really any other school that comes close on the \"all-around\" model. Holder of maybe the world's best economics department, and best engineering school, and best college soccer program, etc. etc. The array of pre-eminent talent there is staggering.\nI say this with respect to UPenn, of course - it's just that Stanford has really established some distance here on this model of education. Also, remember, Stanford has a higher concentrated pool of talent - UPenn's undergrad is 40% larger than Stanford's, but not as accomplished across so many of these areas. So to say a \"slightly lower level\" than Stanford isn't accurate, in my books.

It's rare for students to compete against one another, but if you're part of a frat that has obligations/activities, taking a full course load, committed to the sprint football team, and a leader of two student clubs, it's going to add up.\nThere are LOTS more people who fit the above description at UPenn then there are at Swarthmore, Vassar, etc. ", "user_id": "100441166", "user_name": "Cue7 ", "user_thread_count": "119", "user_comment_count": "2724"}, {"date": {"month": "December", "day": "7,", "year": "2017", "time": "4:47PM"}, "comment": "\n@Cue7 - you're second paragraph above is exactly how I see it and why I jumped into the thread earlier.

Current Penn freshman here procrastinating going to bed because her study playlist is too bangin' to turn it off right now. Also I just finished peer reviewing some essays that made me lose all faith in humanity so I thought to dig around old CC threads and think back to last year.\nI'm in the Biological Basis of Behavior program with the intention of eventually getting my Ph.D. in something (the actual name of my degree would vary based on school, but I would be studying neuroethology), and I'm also majoring in English. I won't be taking English major requirements until next semester so I can't speak to them, but my friend who has taken them says it's a lot of work but generally a good time.\nBBB is a pre-med major, which I didn't realize until I got to my classes and 80% of those kids wanted to be doctors. I think from a mental health perspective it's not the greatest environment for pre-med and pre-academic (which is what I've started calling myself as a jab at the pre-professional kids). If you want to become a professional doctor, lawyer, businessperson, etc. you'll make yourself miserable by four years of competition. Med/law/professional schools tend to care a lot about grades.\nAcademics like me are in kind of a different boat. A few schools have GPA minimums, but overall they care about research. I went to my bio professor's office hours and he told me that in bio 101 \"the best doctors get A's, the best scientists get C's.\" So you have to live with dealing with the pre-professional kids looking down on you for not having perfect grades, but you get over it.\nI also have a fair share of pre-existing mental health issues that made the learning curve really bad. My experience is kind of unique in that I had undiagnosed ADHD and was able to get away with it in high school because I was gifted, but once school got hard and I had to pay attention it was rough. First midterms hit me hard and I ended up going to the school psychologists. Everyone trashes them but I've had positive experiences; I see a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist once a month to get my ADHD medication refilled.\nHere's the best advice I can give about how to be happy at Penn:\n- Don't be pre-professional, or at least don't tie yourself to it. Research is super cool, dude.\n- Make friends who are outside of your grade and major who are really passionate about whatever they do.\n- Go out when you want to, not when you don't. This is super critical; I spent the early part of the semester going out three times a week because my friends wanted to, got super behind in my classes, stopped leaving my dorm at all to overcompensate, and got depressed from not allowing myself to have fun.\n- Go to office hours and talk to your professors. It's a great way to make you feel not alone. My BBB professor told me she got Ds in undergrad and still got into an Ivy League grad school, and my bio professor told me about how he took a year off of grad school to build shelves because he felt \"stuck\". If they could succeed, you can get over one bad semester.\n- Attend one meeting of everything and drop it if you hate it. I started out in 7 clubs and now all I do is band and a radio show because they have flexible time commitments and I enjoy both.\n- You're not going to be perfect at everything. Accept it now. Find the things you're good at and rock it. I was joking with a couple of my friends last week and said \"I'm only good at one thing and it's writing\" and they dropped the self-deprecating humor to tell me that it's amazing that I can write because most people are awful at it.\nI am, overall, really happy here. If I could redo the semester I would and make better choices, but that's why I have 7 more.

Or if you apply RD and you just finished submitting all your essays and stuff. The reason I wanted to post is that I want to bring some perspective into the admissions process, your first year at college, and college in general.\nI currently attend Penn as a sophomore in engineering. My most important and valuable advice is: Please please please do not overhype Penn to be some amazing place that you are *destined* to be at. Please do not create some illusion of how wonderful Penn before even stepping on campus, how you're automatically going to enjoy your next few years here. This goes for every university, not just Penn.\nBecause the truth is, the real Penn would never match up to whatever version of Penn you have created in your mind. Just like any other university, there are unique problems associated with Penn, along with general problems that exist with every college. The point of this post is not to detail every problem with Penn, but to remind you to please be realistic about your dream school(s).\nCollege really is what you make of it. You can get accepted to Penn and come here, but if you don't actively work to shape your life the way you want it, you will be miserable. Guaranteed. Penn, like all other universities, doesn't just hand you opportunities. You have to work and find them yourself, to involve yourself in the community. That's why I also believe that if you don't get accepted to Penn, you will do just as well at another school and enjoy it just as much as if you had attended Penn. Because the people who truly enjoy college know that college is what they make of it. I cannot stress that enough. It is very easy to be disillusioned by university life when you get to the college of your dreams because it doesn't match up to the image you have constructed in your head. College life really isn't all about academics- this is your best opportunity in life to learn about yourself, learn about how to live as a functioning adult, what you value, what you are passionate about, what makes you happy, what makes you you. You might think you know all this in high school, but you come here and you're exposed to so many different people from so many different walks of life. You will be tested with ordeals and experiences that you may never have imagined before. And you will get through them and realize how strong and brave you are.\nAt the end of the day, I am so, so grateful that I attend this university. I can say without a doubt my freshman year at Penn was the best year of my life (so far lol). And this year is turning out to be no different. I have had some of the most unique experiences in this world, met some people who mean all the world to me, done things the high school version of me could have never imagined myself doing. Would I have been just as happy at another school? Yes. Some experiences may have been unique and resulted from my being at Penn, but I believe that I would have had just as many cool and unique experiences at another college. It's important to keep everything in perspective.\nSo I know that a lot of you are unbelievably stressed and nervous and worried about your future. I was in the same boat two years ago. Just trust me when I say that everything will be okay. If you think that you're qualified enough to apply to Penn, then I guarantee that even if you open the portal and don't hear the music and don't read the \"On behalf of...\", you will be okay. You will be okay wherever you go. The important part about college is to learn and grow as human beings.\nIf you have any questions about Penn or engineering or student life in general, feel free to reach out and ask!

The data can be suspect, and the sample size is often quite small; and\n2.) All they reveal is student preferences, which are incredibly whimsical.\nHere's more analysis:\nAccording to Parchment, currently, UPenn wins 85% of the time against Georgetown (and, for reference, UPenn wins 63% of the time against Brown, 69% of the time against Dartmouth, and 50% of the time against Duke).\nIf you go back just ten years, though, the numbers are completely different, even though all these schools haven't really changed that much (in terms of outcomes, culture, standing, etc.)\nIn 2006, for example (when Penn, btw, was ranked noticeably higher than it is now - #4), look at the cross admit data:http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/09/17/weekinreview/20060917_LEONHARDT_CHART.html\nThe numbers are drastically different - Brown won 65% over Penn, Dartmouth took 54% over Penn, Duke only took 35% over Penn, and Georgetown took considerably more over UPenn - 35%\nBut I think even @Penn95 would agree - 10 years ago, the experience and exit options at Brown, Dartmouth, etc. were NOT better than what you find at UPenn, but these schools were winning the cross admit battles. This despite the fact that Penn was ranked considerably higher than these other two schools! (Penn was #4, Dartmouth #9, Brown #15.)\nSimilarly, I don't think Duke has done so much to make up ground since 2006, but it now wins noticeably more cross admits with Penn than 10 years ago (it won 35% in 2006, 50% now).\n(Frankly, if you go back another 10 years to the mid-90s, when Penn was ranked like #13, Brown, Dartmouth, etc. ate Penn's lunch - I'd imagine Brown took like 70-75% of cross admits at that time. Yet, again, as @Penn95 would correctly argue - that really wasn't that much difference in quality between these schools in the mid-90s, no matter what the stark disparities in cross-admit data at this time would suggest.)\nIn reality, after HYPSM, there are about a dozen colleges that offer comparable exit options, a wealth of student resources, and the like. Georgetown and Penn are peers in this sense (as colleges, not as research universities), as are Northwestern and Duke, Hopkins and Dartmouth. Schools have particular flavors and cultures, but, outside of HYPSM, choose for fit.\nIgnore the student preferences data. 10 years from now, they could look markedly different, even though all these schools will likely all be just as strong.

They're based off an estimate which is in turn based off of a survey of 3200 high school seniors during one year in the mid 2000s. Even assuming those data were in any way helpful, at that point in time, Penn had only been ranked in the top 10 for about 8 years and it had a lot of ground to make up regarding its reputation and the reputation of America's urban cores as violent, dangerous places in the eyes of potential matriculants. For those same reasons, Columbia struggled to win cross admits from places like Dartmouth and Brown too. Times have changed over the last two decades however...\nIn any event, I'm not saying that just because parchment relies on 1,000,000 data points across multiple years that its revealed preferences are any more sound than the NYTimes' revealed preferences based on 3200 data points from one year. I am, however, saying that the NYtimes data are not valuable.\nI'm also curious which \"exit options, resources, and the like\" set HYPSM off from schools like Penn and Columbia that would have any impact on the average student at any of those 7 schools.. I'm aware of some recruiters in the business world that only seriously recruit at HYPS and Penn (sometimes Columbia as well)-- setting those schools off from a school like Georgetown. But I'm not sure HYPSM have a lock on any exit options that P&C couldn't get as well... always interested in new info that might show otherwise though@NeedInfo1244 As for the social life at these two schools, I think students are generally pretty happy at both. As has been mentioned, Penn has greek life and approximately 25-30% of Penn students are part of greek life there. However, a much larger percentage of the student body does attend their parties and socials so it will be available to you regardless of your affiliation. That being said, Penn is also a 15 minute walk from the heart of one of America's best & cheapest cities. The food culture in Philly is AMAZING and Penn students often go out to dinner downtown without breaking the bank (something that is more challenging to do in pricier Washington DC). Philly also has BYO restaurants which are very popular among Penn undergrads because they turn a blind eye to underage drinking... for better or worse . Penn is also closer to more of Philly's most exciting attractions but Georgetown is connected by various bussing systems to parts of downtown DC so you'll still have access to the best DC has to offer.\nI would say the average Penn freshman who doesn't join greek life would go to a couple of frat parties during their first semester and eventually make friends with people they like in those fraternities and then they'll continue attending those frats' parties for the next three years if they enjoy that environment. Penn juniors and seniors usually go to bars around campus if they like nightlife or they continue more lowkey activities like movies with friends (there is a theater close to campus), dinner, etc. etc. For most students at Penn, social life revolves around the extracurriculars you join and the college house you're part of. So if you join the debate team, you'll probably hang out with them and the friends you make in your college house, in class, etc. Penn is a *very* social place and so even studying is often part of your social life. Penn students often book Group Study Rooms (GSRs) in Huntsman Hall and Van Pelt Library so that they can hang out in more private spaces where they can talk while they study as opposed to super silent libraries. Though Penn has those too (Fisher Fine Arts Library). Penn's social life is largely what you make of it though. If you want to be a hermit, you can be.

What the preferences look like NOW could be completely different than what they look like in 10 years. (We see that when we compare 2006 to 2016 - and btw, the NY Times data was based on an academic paper by Avery and Metrick - it was considered to provide fairly good data, but, just like Parchment, is imperfect).\nA students college decision will most likely stick for many decades - so why base even part of it on something flimsy like student preferences? I'm not sure why you and others point to parchment - who cares what students are picking now? These choices could change over time, and in fact, over the years, there has been considerable change here. I suspect you'd agree - the preferences in the 90s (where many of these schools ate Penn's lunch), the 00s, and now are considerably different. At the same time, the strength of schools are quite constant over time - Penn in the mid to late 90s was actually quite safe, and it certainly was quite safe/stable in the 00s. Even though the ranking has fluctuated considerably during this period (#13 or so for much of the 90s, top 5 for much of the 00s, #8 or #9 recently), the school's actual standing is quite consistent - same with Brown and Dartmouth and others.\nWho's to say that in ten years things don't flip again - that Penn once again loses 60-70% of cross admits to Brown or Dartmouth or some other school? Moreover, who cares?\nI think if you look at education/outcomes/standing - they are quite constant over many decades. So if Penn wins 65% from Brown (as it supposedly does now), or it lose 65% to Brown (as it supposedly did in 2006), what difference does it make?\nFinally, I've separated HYPMS for reasons that aren't worth going into again - but these are more or less the standard bearers amongst top US unis. That's not to say people choose other schools (as I believe you did), but these are the only five schools where I'd even consider \"prestige/standing\" as a POSSIBLE factor.

And no, I don't agree that Penn's relative strength to schools like Dartmouth hasn't changed since the 90s and I think student preferences could be partially responsive to that-- though I don't know if the data would actually be telling. That's why I *WISH* we had an actual revealed preference information and I wish we knew if it actually was meaningful. But, as I said in my post, the NYTimes data is bad and I didn't say Parchment was good.\nBut as I was saying, the relative strength of Penn vs. (let's say Dartmouth), has not been constant over time.\nIf you're a loyal follower of Dartmouth and Penn, then you know that the 90s was a period of great power for Dartmouth and a period of enormous and inconsistent transition for Penn. Dartmouth had been under *outstanding* leadership for several decades at that point and enjoyed massive fundraising success. They were having enormous success with faculty recruitment and retention. They had a streamlined admissions process that kept the best and brightest heading north.\nBy contrast, Penn was struggling in the 90s, to put it lightly (Also, as a side note- Penn in the mid 90s doesn't seem like it was quite safe. According to wikipedia, Philly's homicide rate in 1990 was 41.7! By 1995 it was still 37 and by 2006 it was 27.7 and it reached a low of 15.9% in 2014). Penn was *just* initiating the College House system in the 90s, they were having massive issues retaining top faculty members, partially due to the pervasive crime that was still an issue for West Philly and partially due to an inability to invest in the resources the best teacher-researchers needed, the hospital system was near bankruptcy and the university's finances were generally a mess across the board (It bears repeating, Penn Medicine, which wasn't Penn Medicine back then, lost nearly $300,000,000 in just 2 years and nearly bankrupted the entire system. in 2000, the system was still $800,000,000 in debt. There wasn't spare cash lying around to get an extra professor so that your intro to english class would only have 25 students). Programs were being cut prior to the 90s but that slowed after Judith Rodin took over. Student housing hadn't been renovated in a generation and no new dorms were on the horizon-- they wanted to build them and even had plans for them! They just didn't have the cash. Penn professors were not required to teach undergrads and class sizes were consistently larger across the board. Frequently, Penn classes were characterized by the horror stories you hear about the \"stereotypical\" ivy league universities with professors more interested in research than undergrads. That wasn't a problem at small, intimate, agile Dartmouth. Dartmouth's undergrad product was solid while Penn's was still recovering from decades of mismanagement and neglect. Penn always benefited from the strength of its grad programs which largely carried the university through the toughest years.\nToday the story has changed markedly. Dartmouth has not had the same massive fundraising success and it has had a string of leadership challenges. Jim Kim, who took over in 2009 seemed less interested in Dartmouth than in setting himself up for his next role at the World Bank. Alumni giving at Dartmouth has decreased markedly. They haven't been able to renovate their failing student housing. The fraternity experience at Dartmouth was exposed for its... shall we say, less than wonderful treatment of its student participants. Dartmouth has actually reversed some of its financial aid policies because it was unable to sustain them. It has also struggled to keep up the strength of its entering class profile and it hasn't been seeing the major increases in applications that its peers have seen. Dartmouth has had trouble raising funds for new housing and it is even considering enlarging its entering class to distribute costs more effectively as its tuition dependence remains a challenge.\nIn contrast, Penn has enjoyed enormous success since the 90s onward that have truly translated into a better undergraduate student experience/education and relative improvement as compared to its peers. Penn's fundraising has been insanely successful. Penn was able to thus invest SUBSTANTIALLY in the student experience, especially in the college of arts and sciences. So today, 75% of the classes in Penn's College have 25 students or fewer and 95% of classes are taught by full professors. Penn built the Penn Alexander school in West Philly and invested a LITERAL ton in improving the area around it which has increased home ownership rates and which has led professors to come en masse to Philly (and stay!! something that just didn't used to happen before to the same degree which made it challenging for students to build relationships with faculty back in the day). Penn has also created the Penn Integrates Knowledge program which has helped with faculty retention and recruitment as well- allowing Penn to poach professors that they never could have dreamed of nabbing even 10 years ago. As a consequence, by almost every measure, Penn's faculty has improved at a pace that Dartmouth has not kept up with. Penn has not only built a new College House and renovated almost every one of its older college houses, it's building *another* new college house by 2021. And that's not even to list the other enormous improvements Penn made to its campus with Penn Park, the Perry World House, renovations to Van Pelt Library, etc. Penn also streamlined access to its One University Policy through the Penn in Touch system which gives modern Penn students access to the faculty in the graduate schools and in its professional schools which have also improved markedly since the 90s (see e.g. Penn Law's improved standing and its vastly improved faculty recruitment and retention).\nAll of which to say, yes, the NYTimes revealed preference info is not pertinent. But revealed preference information COULD be helpful if it were actually responding to the changes in genuine quality that have happened at some schools and less so at others. Penn not only wasn't what it is today back in the 90s, it wasn't what Dartmouth was back in the 90s either! Nearly 3 decades of dynamic leadership at Penn have turned the tides and Penn has outpaced schools that were once outpacing it.

Most other top schools are better now than then too, though. (Dartmouth has many problems now, but it was a different place 20 years ago, especially in terms of student culture - some would say, a lesser place.) Your exegesis over-exaggerates the weaknesses though, and leaves out some context (for instance, Penn's really dark years were in the 70s/80s, and Rodin moved quickly - by the late 90s/early 00s, the undergrad was very much in the midst of a renaissance. U. of Penn Medicine was a different story, and also separate from the undergrad story. Penn Medicine also lucked out with some great hires - like Ralph Mueller, who turned that ship around for myriad reasons. Also, crime in a city is a bit of a red herring - look at UChicago and Hopkins, they're both enjoying great success now in terms of admissions, but crime is a mess not far from both those schools. The truth is, UPenn, like other urban schools, enjoyed a pendulum swing in student preference - away from rural colleges to urban ones. Yes Penn has made strides forward, but so have most of the other top urban unis. In contrast, places like Williams and Amherst - schools that have great leadership over many years - now struggle in comparison.)\nBACK to my main thesis: my whole point is that student preferences are whimsical - they can shift over time, sometimes quickly, You see that in the change from 2006 to 2016. Who is to say what they'll look like in 2026 or 2036?\nA college decision sticks with you a long time - and the preferences in 10 years could look quite different than they do now. Why consider this when the numbers could look very different not long from now?\nThere have been significant pendulum swings in student preference over the past 20 years, but, again, ESPECIALLY over the past 10 years, the standing of schools have been pretty consistent. Yes, maybe Dartmouth's leadership and fundraising have been lackluster, but it's still in an eminent position - UPenn and Dartmouth are still peers, in ways that Penn winning 69% of the cross admit battle does not suggest - just as, in the 90s AND in 2006, Penn and Dartmouth were still peers, no matter what the cross admit data says.@PennCAS2014 - I implore you, don't forget how whimsical student preferences can be. Please don't confuse what students chose (which can shift radically) as indication of a school's strength. If US News decides to preference smaller/rural colleges, and the mis-characterization of Penn as a \"pressure cooker\" amplifies, the picture could look very different - even though these changes might not be meshed in reality. It wouldn't be a stretch to see students choosing Brown or Dartmouth again over UPenn - for the same flimsy reasons that they did in 1996 or 2006.\nFinally, re Yale - I'm not talking about who recruits during OCR - by exit options and resources, I mean that mix of what a school can provide for its undergrads, and the network that can enliven one's exit options (immediately after graduation and beyond). Yale generally is more undergrad-focused than Columbia, and showers resources (be it through their residential college system, the linkages to power, brand both nationally and internationally, etc.) on its students. There are many perfectly good reasons to pick Columbia over Yale, but there are some fairly compelling points in Yale's favor, especially when looked at thru the lens of a college decision carrying forward for some time. As I said before, there are only 5 schools (HYPMS) where these factors should be considered vis a vis the next dozen top places.

What are those five schools ACTUALLY offering that schools like Columbia & Penn can't (not the opportunities they just choose not to offer because of institutional preference, but the ones they literally don't have the capacity to offer)? Yale's residential college system? Well that's unique to Yale and you won't even find that at Stanford or Princeton. Does that mean you shouldn't pick Princeton or Stanford for fit; or do it mean that they're using their resources differently but in ways that translate to different but equally valid opportunities for their students? Should you pick Penn over Princeton/Stanford because it's College Houses are much more similar to Yale's res life than Stanford's is to Yale's? Columbia spends more on giving its students direct access to NYC than Yale spends on the residential colleges which is arguably much more valuable from a \"networking\" perspective that might \"enliven one's exit options (immediately after graduation and beyond).'\nEssentially, if you're going to say that it's okay to look past fit when it comes to HYPSM as compared to every other school, but not okay when comparing P&C to other schools, you need to give some real reasons why. And when you do, you'll see those reasons at most mirror the difference that exist between a Penn and Georgetown. Penn is distinct from a school like Georgetown because recruiters from the business world actually do recruit more heavily and more seriously at Penn than at Georgetown; because the amount of research at Penn is SIGNIFICANTLY greater, better funded, and more highly accessible to undergrads due to Penn's One University policy and the fact that all of Penn's schools are on one campus; because Georgetown's endowment is $1.4 billion while Penn's is $12.2billion (Much closer to MIT's is $14.8 billion and still slightly closer to Princeton's $22.2 billion, than Georgetown's $1.4billion); because Penn pays its professors, on average, more than Georgetown despite the lower cost of living in Philadelphia than DC which has contributed to a more successful recruitment and retainment process for profs. There are *actual* differences in exit options between Penn and Georgetown in the business world, *actual* differences in the amount and accessibility of top flight research between Penn and Georgetown, and *actual* differences in the amount of money Penn and Georgetown have to spend on building/infrastructure, financial aid, etc. etc. etc. Assuming you provide actual evidence that those differences exist between schools like Princeton and Penn/Columbia (which outside of endowment resources, I have yet to see), then you also must explain why those things matter when comparing Princeton and Penn, but why they don't matter when considering Penn and Georgetown.\nBut again, OP, social life at both schools will probably be fulfilling. I think there are other things you might want to consider beyond social life-- but that's up to you. I think you'll be really happy at both from a social perspective since students at both schools are going to be fun, down to earth, and interested in making close friendships and bonds that they'll carry with them through the rest of their professional and persona lives.

The reasons a HYPSM - Penn cross admit will most likely choose HYPSM are more or less similar to the reasons a Penn - GU cross-admit will most likely choose Penn. The reasons being 1. prestige 2. strength in their areas of interest.\nMy theory is that the kind of people who strive for the top schools consider fit as a primary determinant only when looking at schools with similar 1. overall prestige and 2. academic strength in what they want to study. At least this is how my classmates at my east coast prep school chose colleges and how many of my friends at Penn chose as well.

Imo, outside of HYPMS (who have been held in high regard for sometime, and even here Stanford is a newer comer), there is some churn amongst the top schools.\nIf you look at the 80s, 90s, 00s, and now, schools tend to rise and fall as little bit. At one time, Dartmouth Williams and Amherst clearly held rank over many top urban schools. Chicago was a backup for northwestern. Penn and cornell were doormat ivies.

I don't deny that HYPSM (an acronym literally only used here so I can't explain to you how a bunch of 16 year olds decided they liked those 5 schools better than poor little Caltech and wee little Chicago) have more name recognition. Of course they do! But I'm saying that the \"certain rigid hierarchy of schools\" IS INDEED EXHAUSTING! And the vague comments about HYPSM's superiority for undergraduates without evidence that students from those schools are actually finding better jobs, enjoying better resources because other schools lack those resources and not because they choose to provide equally valid but different resources, and the like, actually perpetuates a ridiculous overarching hierarchy that obfuscates actual distinctions between the many schools we often discuss! The name recognition and cachet among those five schools isn't translating into better opportunities than those you would find at the Penns and Columbias of the world anymore, even if they used to back 30 or 40 or 50 years ago. The disparity in \"exit opportunities, ... resources, and the like\" at Penn/Columbia and HYPSM just simply is not greater than those offered by P&C vs Georgetown. But if people on this board insist on recognizing the \"differences\" between HYPSM and Columbia/Penn then they must be equally willing to recognize the EXACT SAME differences between a Penn/Columbia and a Georgetown. It doesn't help me sleep better at night-- it's just the intellectually honest extension of the kinds of comments made in this thread and all over these boards. A 10 billion dollar difference in Penn's endowment and Princeton's only means something if the 11 billion dollar difference between Penn's endowment and Georgetown's also means something. The ten point difference in Penn's entering class' SAT's and Princeton's only means something if the 30 point difference between Penn's entering class' SAT's and Georgetown's means something. The fact that some businesses only seriously recruit at Penn/HYPS and not Georgetown only matters if the fact that all of the same recruiters come to Penn and HYPS. What's good for the goose is good for the Georgetown, is my point.\nAnd if you read through my posts on this board, more often than not (maybe always? but sometimes i get sloppy) i recommend that students pick colleges at which they can thrive and at which they will find genuine joy in what they study. But just because two schools can be peers in a lot of ways, doesn't mean they're identical. So among schools that are all pretty brand-name-y, I usually say \"these are the differences between these schools. These are the ACTUAL differences that we can point to and these are the REAL opportunities you forego by choosing one school over another. These are the standout programs at this school you should really take a look at, regardless of the uni's overall rank or name recognition. But at the end of the day, you've gotta be happy! So go where you'll find yourself most capable of doing well and succeeding.\" But I, unlike many other posters, don't pretend like that advice becomes irrelevant once that magical fairy dust of ~*HyPsM*~ enters the conversation. If those 5 are playing on a different level, educating their students in ways Columbia/Penn could never even dream of, then why are we all ending up with the same jobs and graduate degrees in the same cities and countries?

A college decision is a bit of a gamble, and HYPMS continue to be the best bets out there over the long term. Remember that schools can shift a bit over time, but HYMPS status has been remarkably constant. M and S are relative newcomers, but by that I mean, since pretty much the late 70s, they've been fairly eminent. If you look at USNWR, in 1983, I believe all these schools were in the top 5 (meanwhile, Columbia was barely in the top 20, and UPenn was unranked).\nOutside of these schools, prestige can shift a little - Dartmouth and Brown certainly did better in the 90s, as did Duke. Penn has risen here, but who's to say what things will look like 20 years from now?\nPut another way, I'm most confident about HYMPS maintaining their standing well into the future. Yale is still a better \"bet\" over the long term than UPenn or Columbia, in my eyes. After all, past history dictates that some churn (below the top 5) could occur.\nAnd lest you doubt the flux over time - don't forget in the 1960s, UChicago had the third highest endowment in the country - behind only Harvard and Yale. Now, it's endowment standing is barely in the top dozen.\nSchools can rise and fall. HYMPS seem the most immune to this.\n2.) In your presentation of school strengths, you rarely present the strengths of other schools in the top 1%. So, I don't doubt that UPenn has superb business placement, benefits from the One University policy, has access to great research, etc. BUT, other top 1% schools have strengths in areas Penn may not. I'm sure Georgetown, with it's School of Foreign Service and ready access to DC, has governmental employers/int'l options that simply aren't as readily available to Penn students. Brown, with it's connection to RISD, probably sees options in the creative arts that Penn may not have. All the 1% schools have varied strengths - and you'd do well to acknowledge that more readily in your posts, rather than to jump into endowment performance, student preferences, etc. ", "user_id": "100374735", "user_name": "Cue7 ", "user_thread_count": "119", "user_comment_count": "2724"}, {"date": {"month": "November", "day": "28,", "year": "2017", "time": "10:57PM"}, "comment": "\n@Cue7 Penn as a really awesome program, called Penn in Washington. https://piw.sas.upenn.edu\nIf you want to get a government position you have top access. By the same token Penn is not in New York, but it has no trouble with access to top business jobs compared to Columbia or NYU. But i agree different schools have varied strengths.\nAnyway, regarding your point about the prestige vagaries of the non-HYP ivies, it is rather interesting to see how it played out throughout the 20th century. I d say HYP have remained consistently at the top and Cornell at the bottom. The fortunes of the rest have fluctuated a lot.\nIn the early to mid 20th century Penn was the (distant) fourth ivy choice after HYP for WASP elites. Then in the 50s-70s Columbia started increasing in prominence. Then in the 70s-80s Dartmouth was the hot ivy after HYP and Penn declined a lot. In late 80s to mid 90s Brown became the hot one. Finally since the late 90s until today Penn and Columbia have been gaining in prominence over the others. You could argue that the rise of Columbia and Penn has been partly for the same reasons Stanford and MIT have risen, i.e. the move away from liberal arts to tech/engineering and pre-professionalism. The other reason would be gentrification of inner cities. But yeah who knows that will happen in the next 20 -30 years.

Others, obviously, have more jaded views.\nRegardless, I am of the opinion that one should submit either zero or two (or three if there's a valid reason). Submitting one implies to me that the applicant is trying to hide a score, since virtually nobody takes just one Subject Test.\nAt the end of the day though, whether a school requires/recommends/considers Subject Tests, I believe they are far less important than other parts of the package particular for those colleges that evaluate holistically.

Therefore, we\u2019ve started recommending them for students regardless of whether they submit SAT or ACT tests.\u201d@skieurope Based on this I would bet that lack of Subject Tests hurts most middle/upper (middle) class applicants at least a little bit.

Do you think it'll help if we somehow band together and plead? I found a recent alumnus's comment that provides a pretty good argument,\n\"Penn should admit more students ED, for the sake of the overall campus feel, and also considering that ED applicants increased by 10%. If Penn admits students who love Penn enough to apply ED, then the campus will be filled with students who chose Penn because they loved it, not because they didn't get into HYPSM. It is true that some families may not feel that they can afford Penn; however, people are free to calculate their financial aid through the net price calculators. Penn meets 100% of demonstrated need.\nIf the difference between Penn\u2019s ED and RD acceptance rate grows smaller, there\u2019s little incentive for people to apply ED, especially those who don\u2019t have legacy. In that case, even if Penn were my top choice, I wouldn\u2019t apply ED because I could instead spend more time on my application and have more time to garner awards.\nPenn isn't second tier to other ivies, and if rankings are what determine \"tier-level\", then Penn should feel free to boost their rankings however they want to, especially because it deserves to be ranked higher. Penn's engineering program, for example, only ranks in the top 20, even though I found it much more difficult and rewarding than Stanford's engineering program, which is ranked in the top 3.\"\nTo this I might add that the ED acceptance rate should be much higher than SCEA acceptance rates because EDs are binding (Princeton's is 15%, for example, almost giving the same boost an ED does). Penn's ED acceptance rate of around ~22% might not even be high enough. Northwestern's ED and Swarthmore's ED acceptance rate are around ~35% even though their total acceptance rates are around the same to those of Princeton.

ED contracts can be terminated for financial reasons, but due to the timing (ED decisions come out in Mid-Dec; RD deadline is in early January) most families don't find that to be a viable option either.\nI applied ED, so I appreciate your effort, but the argument is flawed.

What I say follows the quote, explaining how Penn's peer schools have over a 3x ED boost while Penn only has a 2x ED boost.

If I am not mistaken Penn accepts the highest percentage of its class ED than any other ivy, Stanford, MIT. Arguably these are Penn's main peer schools and none of them provides the kind of ED boost Penn provides.\nIf Penn admits students who love Penn enough to apply ED, then the campus will be filled with students who chose Penn because they loved it, not because they didn't get into HYPSM.\n\nThis is not a serious argument. Sure you want people who love Penn but you also want the most qualified people you can possibly get. Having Penn as your first choice is not a reason in and of itself to be admitted. Of course Penn should prefer very qualified HYPSM rejects over more lackluster applicants who applied to Penn ED to maximize their chances (btw there is a good number of those) or because they loved Penn.\nPenn isn't second tier to other ivies, and if rankings are what determine \"tier-level\", then Penn should feel free to boost their rankings however they want to, especially because it deserves to be ranked higher.\n\nThis is not how elite school reputations work, especially for schools already in the top 10. Maybe Penn would deserve to be ranked a bit higher, but no other USNews ranking position within the top 10 would drastically alter how most people perceive it, i.e. as a top 10 school that is a notch below HYPSM. There are many examples of colleges (including Penn) that are ranked or were ranked in the past for many years in the top 5 of USNews but still never managed to be considered on par with HYPSM. A school that is already in the top 10 would be wasting its time chasing a higher ranking. If anything, such blatant use of ED and gaming of rankings makes a school look less elite.\nIf the difference between Penn\u2019s ED and RD acceptance rate grows smaller, there\u2019s little incentive for people to apply ED, especially those who don\u2019t have legacy.\n\nPenn ED acceptance rate is 22%. RD is 7%. Even after accounting for legacies and athletes I guesstimate that the ED acceptance rate is at least 13-15% so there is still a substantial difference there, about double the chances. I can walk you though my calculation if you want but it is long and boring. I basically looked at the reported percentage of legacy applicants (16%), estimated the legacy acceptance rate based a figure reported on the DP ( ~ 40-45%) and determined a somewhat inflated number of athletes in each year (~200).\nIt is true that some families may not feel that they can afford Penn; however, people are free to calculate their financial aid through the net price calculators. Penn meets 100% of demonstrated need.\n\nIf only the reality were as simple and rosy as this. The timing does not always work out. Also many middle-class families are much better off comparing FA packages and negotiating with schools. ED does not allow them to do this. Penn claims it meets 100% of demonstrated need, but this is a very dubious statement and in reality does not always hold true.
