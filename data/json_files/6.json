Which of these options is a \"better\" option that can lead to a higher-paying job in the future?\n2) What are other jobs that this major/these concentrations can lead to OTHER than an environmental law career or a teaching job? Are there any jobs in business or economics or the government that are naturally lead to by this major?\n3) What other colleges and universities offer programs that are the most similar to this?

I sing in a youth choir and toured with them this summer in South Africa. I video the lacrosse team at my school, and I do crew for the play at my school. I am also the co-head of french club this year.\nWhat are my chances? I am particularly interested in how much of a boost the faculty/legacy component is, and if it is only a boost if I apply ED.

I applied and chose to go there because I'm good at STEM, even though I'm not very passionate about it. In the past months I have realised a new love for humanities and my school simply does not offer the humanities subjects I hope to take. This is why I plan to transfer next year, to schools that can offer me both.\nI plan to apply to Penn, amongst other schools. They rejected me RD last year, but I had applied for a STEM major that I had no true passion for, and I'm sure they could tell through my superficial essays. This time I plan to apply for what I am genuinely interested in (something humanities), I have ECs to back up this new interest and I'm sure my essay will turn out much more genuine and passionate.\nBut when I applied last year, the high school grades Penn saw were \"predicted grades\", my eventual grades did not meet all the predictions. For three subjects I was predicted 5 on, I achieved 4. The rest were all ok.\nSo my question: would this significantly hurt my chances? I'm presenting myself in a different angle, with more passion, but lower high school grades than what they saw last time - though I don't think they rejected me because of my grades last year, it was more likely how shallow my essays were.\nI also have the chance to retake one of the exams, which would hopefully become a 5, is retaking it worth the extra studying I would have to do on top of my uni courseload?

I'm an international student from Bangladesh, and I plan to apply ED to Wharton, Upenn. I will sit for the SAT subject tests, on October. On Wharton's website it's stated that I'm required to take 2 subject tests (Math level 2 being one of them). Are two subject tests with a good score (perfect 800, hopefully) sufficient to make me a competitive applicant for Wharton? Or would there be an added benefit if I were to sit for an additional subject test? If there is some benefit, how much of a difference does it make? I understand that subject tests are a very small part of the admission process, but I ask this question, considering that all other factors are constant. To add some context to this, my SAT score is 1520. I sat for the CAIE GCE O levels and AS level examination, getting 90+ in all examinations (maximum possible grade). Hopefully, my predicted grades will be all A*'s. Not elaborating on my extracurriculars here, since the subject tests fall in the context of academics, but I'll surely elaborate on that if needed.

It is perfectly fine to apply to a reach school or two (I consider Ivy and equivalent schools to be reaches for any unhooked applicant) but I strongly recommend that you give up this idea of a dream school and work to create a solid college list that includes reach, match, and safety schools that appear affordable (find out your parents' budget and run the net price calculator for each school) and that you would be happy to attend. Finding those great match/safety schools that appear affordable is an underrated but an absolutely critical part of the college search process. The people I see who get hurt by the college admission process are the ones who focus on one or two hyper-competitive schools and then don't get in. Cast a wide net and recognize that (assuming no major hook) Penn is a reach for pretty much everyone. If you haven't taken the most rigorous curriculum in your HS then it is even more of a long-shot. You need to expand your horizons and recognize that there are many wonderful schools out there where you can have a great 4 year experience and get where you want to go in life.

Imo, those scores won't be why you aren't accepted to any particular school- but I wouldn't apply to any school that requires all of your scores (eg, Georgetown, Duke) as 3 goes at a subject test would likely raise eyebrows (mostly about *why* a student would do that).\nPutting together the pieces from this thread & your others, here is some unsolicited advice: re-consider your college decision process. You mention shotgunning all the fanciest names, and toss around applying to programs as different as engineering and business as if the main thing is the name of the university* and not what you will actually be doing for 4 years/your career. Your post suggests that you have a lot of parental pressure, and of course, all of us want our parents to be proud of us.\nBut:\nYou need to remember that you will be at this school for 4 years, and spending a lot of time studying whatever course you choose. There is no reason not to focus on schools and subject areas that are genuinely interesting *to you*. The point to your parents is that you will be better off targeting those schools where you are a better fit than a scattershot approach.\nStart with what you want to study: I gather it was Engineering, and now it is Engineering with some sort of business focus? Take a hard look at that, and at the engineering programs at the various schools. Whose programs (besides UPenn) look like ones that would suit you?\nThen look at the schools themselves, and the overall experience: which ones are likely to be ones where you will shine? I'm having trouble seeing CalTech or MIT, just based on your chance me thread. Besides having the label \"Ivy\" is there anything about Dartmouth that would make you- or your parents- excited about going there?\nI don't know what your state university is, but if it isn't one of the top ones, then you have a huge jump between your reaches (probably all of the ones on your list; depending on major in a couple cases) and your in-state safety: are there no other schools in between that would be acceptable to you/your family? For example, NW, Rice, GaTech, UMi and UIll-UC have super engineering programs, and are all ranked higher than Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown or UPenn for Engineering. Most of those programs are matches for you, and you (and your parents can point out that you chose it b/c of it's highly ranked Engineering program.\n*yes, I know that some people do both - but from your post it didn't sound as if you had an actual equal interest in both.

Founder/President of Students for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Science (SAIS), an organization where we expand perspective on the field of science by investigating its applications in different fields like business/law (learn about fields like neuroeconomics). The main reason I founded this was to show people that there are more options than just pre-med if you are interested in science. The organization was actually based off a student society I learned about at Penn that focused on neuroscience in business. The president of the student society at Penn actually helped with founding this at my school.\n2.

The good grades/test scores is good (I hope you mean basically perfect, like 3.95+ UW and 34+ ACT) because almost everyone in Penn's dual degree programs has these basically perfect grades/test scores. There is one concern I have though: you didn't tell me any of your actual ECs, you only talked about taking hard classes. Although classes are one type of interest, getting out in the real world and applying them in some way is even more valuable. You can't count \"took a really hard math/physics class\" as an EC. I'm hoping you have more ECs than what you listed, because if not, there's a pretty low chance you can get in. Your ECs will also help you define your M&T essay by showing that you've have an idea about ways the intersection of business and technology could be applied in real life an are interested in it (this doesn't mean having a lot of business experience though).\nI would say to maximize your chance you really need to bring in some ECs on the application, and these will be the real thing that help you stand out. Otherwise, taking classes won't be enough.\nBTW, take this with a grain of salt as I am speaking from knowing many students in the program.

I'm well aware that it's kind of a reach, especially since I don't have any extraordinary EC accomplishments, but I know that Penn's ED acceptance rate is a lot higher because it's binding (close to 20% i think).\nI'm also applying thinking of applying to UMich, Berkeley, UWash in Seattle (safety), and Johns Hopkins (RD if I don't get into Penn, so if you have any thoughts on that please share them.\nBasics:\nFemale, Asian (Indian), not applying for Financial Aid, in-state for UMich\nStats:\n-GPA: UW 3.96 W 4.21 (kind of an upwards trend since I only got A minuses in 9th and 10th grade and 4/5 of my APs were junior year) school does not rank, but my course load is the most rigorous you can take if you're not in double advanced math\n-SAT: 1540 (790 Math 380 R 370 W) 21 essay\n-ACT: 34 C (35 English 33 Reading 33 Math 34 Science) 10 essay\n-SAT Subjects: Math 2 (800) Chemistry (800)\n-APs: Chem (5) USH (5) US Govt (5) Microecon (5) Lang (5)\nSenior Year Classes: (all AP) Calc BC, Physics C, Biology, Lit, Spanish 5, HuG, Macroecon\nECs:\n-President of ChemClub\n-Treasurer/PR for MUN (a couple awards)\n-PR for HOSA (qualified for states 3 yrs in a row)\n-NHS Officer (I know I'll be an officer, but I don't know what position, like for ex, president or treasurer or just 1 of 4 officers)\n-Spanish Honor Society (we tutor spanish-speaking students at elementary schools)\n-JV Cross Country (2 yrs, just to get out of gym)\n-volunteer at local soup kitchen, tutor middle school kids in detroit for math and science, official volunteer for county parks and recreation office\n-Art Portfolio, its like a B+ portfolio i'd say\nHonors:\n-Nat Merit Commended\n-AP Scholar w/ Distinction\n-Nat Spanish Exam Gold (99th Percentile)\n-Runner-up to National Nominee for Chem Olympiad (I'm in a really competitive section but don't go to an as competitive school, so this was the best we've done in a decade I think)\nOk, so I know my teacher recommendations (AP Chem and Microecon teachers, had a 100 in both classes) and essays should be pretty good since my teachers like me pretty well and I'm a pretty good narrative writer, but don't know my counselor at all, hopefully I can make her like me enough to write a non-mediocre recommendation before apps are due. And, I know U of M is a match, since basically everyone at my school with above a 1400 gets in, but my sister applied EA 2 years ago to LSA with better stats than me and was waitlisted, so I'm kind on edge.\nAlso, do you think that the 33 math weakens my application significantly, since I want to go into engineering? I was hoping the 800 on math 2 and 790 sat math would be enough to make up for it. Additionally, a 34 is slightly less than a 1540 so I don't really need to send both, but I paid like 70 dollars to take it and that would a waste, and if I don't send it might look like I did way worse on the ACT than I actually did.

If your anxiety reflects your students, then you can best help her/him by ratcheting it down, emphasizing that there are a lot of paths to get to the same destination (ie, no one college/set of colleges is the be-all) and letting that GC you are paying for through tuition take the lead.\nIf it is your anxiety, b/c that is the path you believe best for them, please take 2 steps back. I am related to, and see every year in my kid's classes, kids whose parents have made it clear that any college 'less' than X (specific name or group such as \"Ivy\") is not good enough- and then the kid doesn't get accepted to X. The damage it does to the kids and the families is heartbreaking to watch. The kid not only gets the sting of rejection, but feels as if they have failed their parents- even though they almost always have acceptances to other academically excellent colleges. It's a terrible moment for a parent when they realize how much extra, unnecessary pain their kid is in and is gutted; it's even worse when the parent has put so much of their own ego into it that *they* feel embarrassed or like a failure, b/c that compounds the kid's misery.\nEither way, the difference in career trajectory between the graduates of super duper selective, super selective and the merely very selective is simply not that big in the US.

Also, I think business is an extremely valuable field in the world, with the potential of making the biggest impact.\nEthnicity: Asian\nGender: Male\nState: Colorado\nHere is a background of my high school career so far:\nGPA: UW 4, Weighted: 4.286 (9/555 in my school) < pretty competitive public school\nSAT: 1540 (math 790) Essay: 20\nACT: 34 (math 35, english 35, reading 34, science 33, essay 10) - I am currently debating on whether to retake this test or not. I know applying to Wharton/Huntsman places a lot of emphasis on math so I think a 35 is good there. Do you know what admission officers think about retaking tests, and do you recommend me to retake mine?\nI currently work two jobs right now: 1 at Kumon (tutoring center) as a tutor, grader, checkin, and another at a local recreation center where I am the front desk for the indoor tennis pavilion. As senior year gets more busy, I may drop one of these jobs. I am debating because although Kumon pays 1.3$ less/hour, it is more valuable in the longer as an experience.\nI am also planning on going to Taiwan this summer for a volunteering opportunity to teach English at the elementary schools. I think this will really stand out on my application and contribute to my demonstrated interest in China and Asia.\nECs:\n-Interact Club (9-12, officer)\n-MUN (11-12, vice president) TSA (10-12)\n-Math club (11-12, potential officer position/president) National Honor Society (11-12)\n-National Science Honor Society (11-12 potential officer)\n-National Spanish Honor Society (11-12)\n*I only did DECA my freshman year, and have not done FBLA or DECA since because they require a year long class each year to be eligible for the club.\n-I hope to have over 200 hours of community service by graduation. I have 60 currently but my summer experience will really contribute as well as other things during my senior year.\nAwards: Not too many, a few generic ones like the AP Scholar and NMSQT Commended Students (I got a 1450 so I don't think I will be a semi finalist)\\\nChinese Essay Award (national competition, forgot exact name)\nThen a potential President's volunteer award from the Taiwan camp\nI am planning with a few friends to start a Tile Talks chapter this year. Visit Tiletalks.co for more info\nI am taking CALC BC right now and am planning on taking Calc 3/Differential Equations and AP Stats senior year, as well as both AP Econs.\nAP Scores: APHG (5), AP Physics (2, lol not a science guy), AP Euro (5), AP Chinese (5). In my junior and senior year, I will be taking APUSH, AP Environmental Science, Lang, Calc BC, Gov, Lit, Stats, Bio, both econs\nAlso planning on taking SAT subjects in Math 2, Bio E/M, Chinese (maybe US History)\nI am open to any and all criticism as well as any suggestions about my current jobs, potential opportunities/actions I should pursue, other schools with programs/curriculum associated with my interests, etc. Thank you for your time!

I remember when my brother was rejected from Yale, I was pretty incensed. He had comparable stat's and was a student leader in a way that I was not (President of his class and a couple of other student organizations). At the time, I felt there were certainly many legacy classmates that were not as well qualified as my classmates who were unhooked. Indeed, during that period (late 70's to early 80's), legacies made up 20-25% of each class. It is down to 12% today.\nWhen it was time for my kids to apply, we were not going to not make use of the advantage. I am also not going to apologize for the fact that they grew up in a stable loving family that valued education and that we had the means through my wife's and my hard work to afford educational enriching trips, test prep, sports teams, etc... One reason why so many of us work hard and sacrifice is to provide a better life and more opportunities for our kids. As for my kids, they worked their butts off academically and athletically. Both were well qualified, but only 1 got in. I have many classmates/friends whose kids did not get in with amazing qualifications. Who knows the strengths of their LoR's or essays, but these were kids that were 2200+ SAT's and top 5% of their classes in competitive HS's. If someone can prove that legacies who got in as a whole are less qualified academically than the rest of the student body, I would agree that that is a problem -- in fact my understanding (at least from Yale's AO) is that legacy admits are actually slightly stronger in academic stat's. If what is happening is that their status is what helps them over the top against comparable applicants, then I don't see that as a problem as the university is trying to account for a legitimate interest in keeping alums engaged and supportive. Also as times goes on, the legacy advantage does not also act as an advantage for white students as minority students have been steadily gaining admissions share. Twelve to 14% legacy admits, as long as they are equally qualified, doesn't strike me as being excessive.

Jerome Allen wasn't an assistant coach when this happened, he was the head coach. He is also, or was, pretty much Mr. Penn Basketball -- probably the best player ever to have played at Penn, taking into account skill changes over time.

He was not so successful a head coach -- for one, his recruiting was not first rate -- but he was still pretty beloved around Penn. And he's not without skills. Working as an assistant coach for one of the top teams in the NBA isn't something to sneer at.\n2. I, too, was struck by what a bargain the guy got. $74,000? That's not a 95% discount. It's probably more like a 98% discount to what it would cost to buy your way in to Penn for a qualified but not academic superstar legacy.\n3. Reading carefully, I'm not so certain that Allen pocketed any of this money personally. Or much of it. The $74,000 includes \"a recruiting trip to Florida\" and private jet rides in two years, as well as cash. If those jet rides were connected to the recruiting trip, or other recruiting trips, and depending on the number of flights, it's entirely possible that the university got benefit out of most if not all of the, um, contribution.\n4.

It certainly shows that you are very serious about your future college preparation. I have seen quite a few people with your background applying to several undergraduate physics/astrophysics such as Princeton , uchicago, mit, Harvard or penn. One thing you must remember once you step into this physics field at such high level research institutes, you will find yourself be surrounded by all people with or above your level. IMO, IPO finalists or medalists, high score AIM holders etc.will all be taking similar classes with you, my point is to suggest you to keep raising your mathematics skill to even higher level to prepare for your intended major no matter which U that you may end up.\nNow your interests in astrophysics, or more formally called cosmology is an extremely exciting field, especially after a gigantic push by S. Hawking. If you don't want to travel too far to some other states, then Steinhardt at Princeton is a big name in this field, he is the Einstein professor at Princeton and formally from PENN physics and if you ed penn this coming year and get in (I don't see why not), you will find all the advance astrophysics/cosmology/string theory/ differential geometry famous professors at this University. Do some research and will see why I say this. Hope you will find the info useful, and keep up your math and physics work. Good luck to your journey.

I asked that a few posts up, and @f2000sa insisted that once they go above target, that becomes the new target for that year since they are already planning on that number. I disagree, and agree with you.\nMany very selective schools (Harvard, Yale, etc.) have already pulled from their wait lists, and Penn has not. To me, that speaks volumes. The fact that there has been no movement (other than releasing a whole bunch of kids) tells me that Penn is over enrolled, and is just keeping a small extended list in case any of the 4 schools falls below target. Dean Furda said in his blog post on 5/12 that they hope to finalize the wait list by mid-June (3 weeks from now). He also said any activity will be limited in scope (while not promising that there would be any activity at all), and he urged students to make plans to enroll elsewhere. Those statements, combined with no wait list movement two weeks after the RD enrollment deadline, seems like a very gentle way to urge people to forget about Penn while keeping the list officially open in case things radically change in the next month.@f2000sa seems to think that Penn will pull one for one off the wait list list for every kid who was a \"yes\" on May 1st that ends up not enrolling. We'll see, but I would not be shocked when they release final numbers if it turns out they are over enrolled and they take no one from the wait list this year. I think the target is the target, they don't want to be above it or below it, and they will actually be happy to have some kids drop off to go to other schools if they are above target, and those kids will not be replaced. The fact that have to accommodate 2500 if that's what they have on 5/1 does not mean they want to accommodate that many. If they did, that would be their target!\nTo my understanding, the purpose of the wait list is to fill a class if their yield projections end up being too optimistic, not to replace students who drop out of an over enrolled class as long as the class remains over enrolled. Some schools (Vanderbilt comes to mind) intentionally under enroll the class through RD so they can pull kids off the wait list and artificially increase their yield by taking the remaining kids from a pool where they have indicated a strong likelihood to enroll if admitted. Traditionally, around 7% of Vandy's class comes from the wait list. Penn, on the other hand, does not do this with its wait list. Penn increases its yield by taking a disproportionate amount of its class through binding Early Decision, and then uses its wait list for its traditional intended purpose (to fill seats left vacant by overestimating yield) rather than as a planned vehicle for accepting students into its class.\nThat said, there really is no reason to debate the point -- we'll see in a few weeks if anyone came off the wait list, and then we'll see when the publish statistics where the class is compared to the target. If there is wait list movement and that school is above target, then @f2000sa is right and I am wrong. But today, my vote (based on lack of activity to date) is all 4 schools are above target and there will be no wait list movement at Penn this year.

Two questions that you probably don't have the answer to:\n1-while the class as a whole had a higher yield, were any of the 4 schools under enrolled? If so, that would explain the limited movement off the wait list.\n2- I'd bet both your number and @bananas99's are correct for 2020. Penn probably offered admission to 58 from the wait list and enrolled 20. I'd bet that was to fill 20 spots in one or more of the 3 smaller schools while arts and sciences was over enrolled (or vice versa), thus accounting for the overall larger class size while still utilizing the wait list. The $64,000 question -- was any of the wait list movement in 2016 prior to May 24th? If so, it's not particularly relevant to this year's wait list.\nFinally, why do your think WL and EWL serve different purposes? WL is larger than the number of students offered admission. It is huge, and not necessarily reflective of Penn's needs. It is set to give them a huge cushion, and a variety of potential needs to fill as it rounds out its class. It's also probably to appease the egos of legacy and VIP kids by giving them an intermediate step before rejection. After a few weeks, when sees what its yield actually is, Furda whittles it down to a few hundred to actually fill gaps in the class and/or shortfalls in enrollment.\nWhy do you think the first list is to fill the class, and the second list is to maintain the high water mark established on 5/1 if the class is over enrolled. What is your source? I noticed above you said Penn had already made arrangements for the overflow and was therefore committed to maintaining it. Where does that come from? Why do you think Penn places overflow incoming freshman in overflow housing on 5/2, and is therefore committed to that number, as though Penn doesn't lose students every year due to wait list movement at peer (and dare I say, above peer, institutions)??\nThe Penn admissions function is a very well oiled machine. If there has been no wait list movement after all this time, the odds are good there won't be.

I have no idea what the yield was, and was only offering a suggestion as to how both 20 and 58 could have been correct numbers, but it's as likely Penn admitted 20 students from 58 admissions as it is that they enrolled 58! Kids stay on the wait list for lots of reasons, including just wanting to see if they get in. Moreover, lots of kids who really intend to enroll if admitted change their minds when they actually get the letter, either because of FA or because they emotionally or financially invest in a school that already admitted them.\nAgain, while this is all interesting, the fact remains that as the days drag on with no movement, it becomes less and less likely that anyone is going to be admitted off the extended WL.

I don't want to come off as argumentative. Hiring an accountant to help with taxes etc etc makes sense. The tax application/applicant is not being judged. This is true for your other examples as well. However hiring a college admissions \"advisor\" is like hiring an expert to help you create a painting, a work of art that is being judged as your own. Someone who advises you on what type of composition will be rated highest using their years of experience, and who shows you the best way to pick the colors, directs you on the brush strokes, and tells you where and when to display your work etc. In the end who's painting is it? These experts charge 10s of thousands of dollars to create impressions. The community advisors you refer to simply give advice as to when to take the SATs, to get involved in activities etc. The paid expert is really a college applications marketing expert, not a simple advisor who is counseling students for free. These experts are hired very early on in the student's career. Sometimes in middle school.\nThis is a side track and I wish everyone the best of luck--wherever their student ends up.

Penn has an urban campus and is in a less than desirable area of Philadelphia (though it\u2019s improving slowly). Cornell is very rural with a gorgeous campus that\u2019s quite far out of the way. Penn is very pre-professional and the culture can be competitive. I don\u2019t know the culture of Cornell.\nIn order to get into either school, you\u2019ll need to demonstrate passion for something and improve your extracurricular/employment activities as well as your ACT score. Fortunately you\u2019re starting early and you\u2019ll have plenty of time. I recommend an internship in a field of interest or volunteer work that ties into your passion. The ACT people have a fairly new website where you can upload your score and it will create a computerized practice schedule for you based on the areas in which you need to improve. Best of luck!

I figured the governors school would help with that since it\u2019s health related. There\u2019s also a place that works with sending lightly used medical supplies to countries in need.. I was thinking about volunteering there a bit this summer. I thought this would especially be a strength for Cornell since in CALS I\u2019d be applying specifically to the bio major. I\u2019ve toured both schools and both have positives and negatives to the point that it\u2019s basically a toss up between which I want to go to. I want to apply ED tho so I need to pick one. I just worry that if I apply ED to penn and don\u2019t get in it might be harder to get in RD at Cornell, and so I may not get into either. I know they say ED has the same criteria as RD which I\u2019m sure that it does but I also think the odds of getting in when compared to 6k applicants is far better than when compared to ~50k.
