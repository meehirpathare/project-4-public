I'm utterly confused and lost.\nI am interested in becoming a journalist when I grow up, but that may change, so I want flexibility. I got into Medill at Northwestern (the journalism school) and the college of arts and sciences at UPenn. I am the first person in my high school to get into NU in over 7 years, and about 15 at UPenn.\nI know both places are amazing academically, and I will receive a great education no matter what. At the same time, I recognize that UPenn is an \"ivy league,\" and Northwestern is not, but that won't impact my final decision too much.\nAnyways, my number #1 priority in a college is most certainly ... the people. I want to be around really kind, friendly, and intellectual people who love to learn. I'm not too into greek life or partying. I just want to be around people who are down to Earth, hard working, and humble. I want a lot of friends and a strong sense of community.\nAs of now, I feel like the people at Northwestern seem kinder, but I don't want to make snap judgements about entire school populations. I also know UPenn has an AMAZING newspaper, so I'm sure the community is good.\nAny thoughts?

Medill encourages students to double major in Weinberg (Arts & Sciences). Easy to switch majors & schools at Northwestern.\nNorthwestern has a fairly spectacular setting in a Chicago suburb on Lake Michigan, while Penn has Philadelphia.\nPenn's overlap schools: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Georgetown, & Northwestern.\nNorthwestern's overlaps: Yale, Stanford, Harvard, Michigan, UPenn, Princeton, WashUStL, & Duke.\nIntellectually & academically, both are powerhouses.\nFor down to earth, humble, hard-working, kind, friendly & intellectual people, I would lean toward Northwestern University, but both are full of bright, driven, hard-working students.\nIf you need or crave the Ivy League label, then UPenn is the choice; but, for Ivy League academic quality, students & endowment, both are fine.\nFor academic flexibility, Northwestern is clearly the better choice.\nP.S. If you find UPenn's newspaper to be amazing, then try to implement changes / adjustments to Northwestern's newspaper to match those aspects which you most enjoy.

Northwestern most likely has more clout to launch a journalism career.\nIf you really have reasons to like Penn better (like, for example, you strongly prefer the Mid-Atlantic region to Chicago), it's a great choice too. But don't choose it a) because it's an Ivy or b) because they amped up the excitement of the acceptance by playing hard to get.

However, I don't know if I want to stay confined to journalism to such a strong extent. Like you said, Northwestern does encourage cross disciplinary studying, and I could envision myself pursuing a major/minor in Weinberg too, but I would still be housed in Medill.\nAlso, what I just learned tonight is that Penn has a journalistic writing minor, which, while it does not provide the same sense of community as Medill, which is 180 kids a year, it covers some of the same topics I would imagine.\nAnd, thirdly, I would be lying if I said I don't crave the ivy league label, but I am mature enough to know experiences are more than titles.

Penn strives for 100% alumni interviews for its applicants, and if video calls aren't your kid's thing, request a phone call instead. I'm not interviewing this year as my daughter is applying, I hope to start up again next year.\nPS - we have no access to applications or scores. The only thing alumni interviewers get is a student's name, proposed major and college, and contact info. That's the most frustrating thing about being an alumni interviewer, you can be talking to the brightest, most articulate kid in the world, but if they don't have the stats, essary, and scores for the program they are applying to, it doesn't matter how the alumni interview went.

The least popular or populated sorority. Girls aren\u2019t well known across campus, and don\u2019t get invited to social events that are highly desired. Typically the first sorority that girls will cut during rush, along with another one that might not fit their vibe.\nAlpha Phi - its origins date back to Kappa Kappa Gamma, Penn\u2019s oldest sorority. It rechartered as APhi due to administrative complications. Traditional wealth, girly girls with style and confidence. Thought of by some as being too snobby. Always included in social events across the frat top tier.\nChi Omega - a lot of girls\u2019 backup sorority on account of not having one particular quality that makes it stand out but not having a particularly negative stereotype either. Because of this however, the girls tend to not be super involved or attend social events. Friendly girls\nDelta Delta Delta - thought of as the party girl sorority. Girls are known for going out a lot. There was a chant people did on SNL called \u201cdelta delta delta can I help ya help ya help ya\u201d meant to poke fun at the girls for not being academically the most serious. Of the top tier, least deserving of its status.\nKappa Alpha Theta - very heavily Jewish and not super diverse. Known for wearing all black and heavy drug use. The least friendly of the top groups. Very recognizable at penn. Has had a harder time pulling girls recently due to some racial incidents but hopefully the organization can address these changes.\nSigma Delta Tau - the backup for a lot of girls that want to be in Theta. Also very heavily Jewish, and sort of similar although less edgy and not as good of fraternity relations. SDT had a reputation nationwide as being super jappy and this holds true at penn as well.\nSigma Kappa - a quiet group. Seems to want to participate in the social climb but doesn\u2019t have girls that are dedicated or wealthy enough to make it happen. Also a pretty diverse group, and doesn\u2019t pull any specific type of girl.\nZeta Tau Alpha - somewhere between SK and ADPi. Also one girls tend to rank last early on in the rush process. Down to earth girls but a bit socially awkward. A welcoming place for girls that might not have found a place in the Greek process otherwise.
